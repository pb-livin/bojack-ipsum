Horsin' Around is filmed before a live studio audience.
Hey. Where? I'd love hay.
The show was initially dismissed by critics as broad and saccharine and not good.
I parked in a handicapped spot, I hope that's okay? I'm sorry, disabled spot, is that the proper nomenclature?
No, I don't think I should drive right now, I'm incredibly drunk.
Is it just me, or am I nailing this interview? I kind of feel like I'm nailing it.
Is it okay to say shit?
It's not Ibsen, sure, but look, for a lot of people, life is just one long, hard kick in the urethra.
Did I already say the thing about the urethra?<br><br>
I, uh... Uh, I... Um...
Why so gloomy, roomie?
Well, we don't need to put labels on things.
I've had tapeworms that were less parasitic.
If you're looking for the Toaster Strudels, I got really high last night and ate them all.
Did you say you've had tapeworms?
Just an issue with the bank and a lack of money in it.
"BoJack Horseman: The Bojack Horseman Story, written by BoJack Horseman. Chapter one. Chapter one. Chapter... one."
When was the last time you saw a book? I thought I saw someone reading one in the park the other day, but it turned out it was a takeout menu.
I'm from Cincinnati.<br><br>
"Neigh way, Jose." I improvised that line. I mean, it was written, but I gave it the old BoJack spin.
Yeah, but do you get it though, because "nay" means no, but it's also a thing horses say? It works on every level.
Todd, I weigh over 1200 pounds. It takes a lot of beer to get me drunk.<br><br>
Ha-cha-cha.
I think we should see other people. Were we not seeing other people?
Now that's a horse of a different... cruller?
Oh, God, that's good comedy.
Hey, aren't you the horse from Horsin' Around?
Mr. Peanutbutter and BoJack Horseman in the same room. What is this, a crossover episode?
Oh, living the dream, P.C., living the dream.
Always a Clydesdale, never a Clyde, eh, BoJack?
Erica, get out of here with that face.
So it's not because of the thing with the baby? It's because of a lot of things!
$10 for bread?
I don't want to live in a society where the premeal bread isn't free.
You ate nine baskets, sir.
Great, now I'm gonna feel like a fat ass all week.
You've seen me naked. Do you think I'm getting chubby?
This is so classic you.
You think I'm fat.<br><br>
"Dumb guy eats bread, gets fat, the end."
Wasn't there a pizza here a second ago?
That was a good party.
Oh, everything's my fault.
But I'm not looking for parking in Silver Lake.
Wait, wait, so which pile of crap do I look like?
I was masurbating to what the picture represented. You walked in at the worst possible moment!
So, Tuesday, though?<br><br>
We made a series of very bad investments.
Then why did we spend $20 million on marketing?
It's okay, Pinky, go to your happy place.
I live a very active lifestyle.
Little Sabrina grew up right before our eyes, right, Todd? Todd? Todd!
Diane "Nugent"?
We can't afford to be giving out free books to people, but you can take anything you want from the Swamp Monsters swag box.<br><br>
Easy for you to say, you hippie.
And that's for trying to sell E on the cartel's turf.
She went back to Mexico City, ese, to be with her husband. What? No! Gabriela, why?
You know what my problem is? I can't say no to people because I want everyone to like me.
Uh... What were we talking about?
"Stupid BoJack writes a stupid book about his stupid life, comma nobody cares."
What newspapers are you reading?
We had sex last night, dummy.
Ugh, I really gotta start putting my phone on airplane mode when I drink.
I hate her and her stupid, impossible-to-pronounce last name, "Na-goo-ya-go-goo-goo-goo-ga."
Ow, ow, ow!
You owe me a party, cabr&oacute;n, and if you don't deliver-- Because parties are fun?
Everyone thinks that I'm just this washed-up hack.
I can't breathe. Am I dying? Toast. I smell burning toast!
Todd, on my grave, I want it to say that I was born in 1975.<br><br>
We might have gone too dark on that series finale.
I'm required to hand you over to the child protective services. You're the state's problem now.
Linus walked around with a blanket and no one gave him shit for it.
You have other clients?
Too smart for the room? It was a salsa joke, people!
He doesn't have a job. He has no real responsibilities.
I can try, doctor. I can try.
What, you want me to call this woman? On the phone?
Really, not even a pity laugh? I did almost die.
You have other patients?<br><br>
Se&ntilde;or Horseman, I will never forget your generosity today.
Mwah. Let's dance!
Oh, you know, just a variety of folks from all walks of life.
Is this a quincea&ntilde;era?
I find that pi&ntilde;ata offensive.
If you'll excuse me, I have a Virgin of Guadalupe pendant to present.
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.
Can you believe this, the two of us in the same house? Is this a crossover episode? No, I'm just kidding around, man.
Living the dream, huh? Yeah.
Erica, how are you looking so beautiful? I'm furious.<br><br>
It's Diane? Oh, Diane.
Have you tried alcohol?
Like, look at that guy. He's having fun.
What guy?
Shut up, Diane. You're at a party, compliment the host. You have a lovely home.
Well, mostly I just sit around the house and complain about things.
No, I will not have sex with you!
What a dumb idea for a TV show.
Who wants an autograph?
That is profoundly sad.
Gay joke. Sorry, I'm better than that.
Most people don't even get to do The Brady Bunch version of the thing they want to do with their lives.
I'm responsible for my own happiness? I can't even be responsible for my own breakfast.
Todd! I need help.
Don't put all that stuff about how sad I am in the book.
Starting now.<br><br>
Ugh, this guy. Hey, man, wanted to let you know, you are out of beer.
You drank all my beer? Also, you two are dating?
But in a sexual way? Oh, yes. Oh my God.
Oh, this is really-- wonderful. Starting now.
Back in the '90s I was in a very famous TV show.
I guess I'll just try to make you understand that I'm more horse than a man. Or I'm more man than a horse.
