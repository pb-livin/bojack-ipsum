BOJACK: I don't know, it's-- I don't want to spook the baby. Maybe we should just do mouth and hand stuff for the next nine months.

BOJACK: Harper?

HARPER: Do you think if you were a little kid, we would be friends?

[20:52]
BOJACK: Well, that depends. Do you love cookies, and the color green, and braids?

[20:56]
HARPER: Yes, I love all those things.

CAROLYN: BoJack, I read the pages you sent me last night, and I have to tell you, your book is absolutely, without a doubt, the most... gibberish. It's gibberish.

[21:53]
BOJACK: What day is it?

[21:55]
CAROLYN: Let's see what you got here. You got 20 pages of Doctor Who erotic fan fiction, a recipe for soup, five different theories about how 9/11 happened, and a bunch of embedded YouTube videos that can't possibly be printed in book form.

[22:18]
GIRL IN AUDIENCE: Um, yeah, I have a question for Tori Spelling.

[22:21]
PINKY: Again, Tori Spelling is not here, as I already explained. Tori Spelling's ghostwriter is here. This is a ghostwriter convention. How do you not-- [clears throat] Okay, next question?

[22:34]
GUY IN AUDIENCE: Uh, yeah, this is for the whole panel. What's your favorite kind of ghost to write for?

[22:39]
PINKY: What? No, they don't write for ghosts. That's not wha-- Why did I think this would be a good idea? Does anyone have an actual question for someone on this panel? An actual question, or a gun, so I can shoot myself?

[22:55]
BOJACK: Yeah, I got a question.

[22:56]
PINKY: Oh, thank God.

[22:58]
BOJACK: [microphone feedback] My question is for Diane. Look, I'm sorry about all the stuff I said about you earlier. We can publish the book you wrote. You're obviously a better writer than I am, and I don't actually even really care what the world thinks about me anymore. I just hated reading that book because I hated feeling like that's how you saw me. Because I guess you know me better than anybody, and if you think that-- Um, I guess my question is, do you-- Do you think it's too late for me?

[23:26]
DIANE: What?

[23:28]
BOJACK: I mean, am I just doomed to be the person that I am? The-- The person in that book? It's not too late for me, is it? It's-- It's not too late-- Diane, I need you to tell me that it's not too late.

[23:38]
DIANE: BoJack, I--

[23:39]
BOJACK: I-- I need you to tell me that I'm a good person. I know that I can be selfish and narcissistic and self-destructive, but underneath all that, deep down, I'm a good person, and I need you to tell me that I'm good, Diane. Tell me, please, Diane. Tell me that I'm good.
