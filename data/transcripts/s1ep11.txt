Whoa!

[00:14]
[BoJack] Okay, how about this one?

[00:16]
BoJack swallowed a dozen pastries in the time it took

[00:19]
the caterer to unwrap a fruit tray.

[00:20]
When she asked where the pastries had gone,

[00:22]
BoJack claimed he had no idea,

[00:24]
spraying her with bits of buttery crust?

[00:27]
[laughs] I did that once.

[00:29]
Oh, but with holiday cookies.

[00:32]
I had sprinkles all over my sweater.

[00:34]
See? People respond

[00:36]
to the flawed portrait I painted of you.

[00:38]
They see themselves in it.

[00:39]
Why do you love Secretariat?

[00:41]
Uh, because he was awesome?

[00:42]
No, because he was flawed.

[00:44]
BoJack, when people find out that someone like you,

[00:46]
who seems larger than life, is actually just as wounded

[00:50]
and vulnerable as they are, it makes them feel less lonely.

[00:53]
Ugh, no! Maybe that's what flawed,

[00:55]
sad fatties want from other celebrities,

[00:57]
but for BoJack Horseman,

[00:59]
they want a heroic horse-stud who is awesome

[01:01]
and who can save them from their flawed, sad, fatty lives.

[01:04]
- You're so wrong. - Actually, you know what?

[01:06]
Now that I think about it, I think that you're so wrong!

Listen, we all agree Diane broke contract

People want to read more, and we have to

get this to the printers by the end of the week,

because that's when the repo men are coming

[01:22]
to take away our printers.

[01:24]
The end of the week? No!

[01:25]
Okay, what if I told you that I could have

[01:27]
a new book for you by then?

[01:28]
- What? - Yeah, a better one.

[01:31]
Better stories, better told, by me--

[02:02]
Why don't I write a book about how you married Mr. Peanutbutter

I'm just sick of nerd-girls like you beating up on stars like me.

[02:14]
It's pathetic! I'm sorry no one wanted

[02:16]
to date you in high school, Diane,

[02:18]
but I don't see why I have to suffer just because

[02:20]
you were never especially pretty or interesting.

You really let me down, BoJack.

[02:26]
You really let me down.

[02:27]
I apologize for her outbursts.

[02:30]
So, you really think you could write a better book by Friday?

Damn right I can, so you can throw this turd of a book

Todd, are you holding a gun or a broom?

Oh, man, can we just stay exactly like this

Yeah, and I'm 80% sure it's yours.

gibberish.

- It's gibberish. - What day is it?

Let's see what you got here.

You got 20 pages of Doctor Who erotic fan fiction,

a recipe for soup, five different theories

What's your favorite kind of ghost to write for?

What? No, they don't write for ghosts.
