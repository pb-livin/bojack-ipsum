It was wicked messed up.

[14:28]
[somber organ music]

[14:30]
Tell me about your father.

[14:32]
Well, he was a mean, sadistic alcoholic,

[14:35]
who never supported anything I did

[14:37]
and actively delighted in seeing me fail.

[14:39]
Hmm, I see.

[14:41]
Sounds like you're looking for our Piece of Shit Dad Package.

[14:44]
That would be too good for my father.

[14:46]
Hmm, I see.

[14:48]
Might I then suggest our Piece of Shit Dad Package

[14:51]
Would Be Too Good For Him Package.

[14:54]
Yeah, that's the one.

[14:55]
Excellent choice.

[14:58]
Hey, can I suggest something?

[15:00]
You might want to loosen up a little.

[15:02]
I think you could actually learn a thing or two

[15:04]
from your brothers.

[15:05]
Are you kidding?

[15:07]
If I was like my brothers, nothing would ever get done.

[15:09]
I'm just saying,

[15:10]
if you can't find a way to let off some steam

[15:12]
you're going to explode. [phone rings]

[15:15]
God damn it! Are you god damn kidding me?

[15:16]
I keep getting calls from this unlisted number.

[15:18]
Ignore. Who are these assholes?

[15:20]
Why don't you just answer, and then you'll know?

[15:22]
Oh, they'd just love that, wouldn't they?

[15:23]
Ugh, how are we supposed to blackmail him

[15:25]
if we can't reach him?

[15:27]
Maybe we got to get him where he lives?

[15:29]
You mean--?

[15:31]
That's right, his house.

[15:34]
[horns honking]

[15:35]
What the-- Whose house is this?

[15:37]
Is that David Boreanaz?

[15:39]
I could've sworn BoJack Horseman lived here.

[15:42]
Hey, let's keep these lines moving, huh?

[15:43]
You want to stop and chat,

[15:45]
you gotta pay for the extended stay ticket.

[15:47]
Ah, so much, so much, so much.

[15:49]
Another five Gs, T-Bag, and we are in the pink.

[15:52]
I don't know, Princess Carolyn.

[15:53]
I ran out of shoeboxes for the money,

[15:55]
and the books aren't adding up.

[15:57]
Plus the men's lav needs to be serviced,

[15:59]
and I had to fire Janine in the gift shop

[16:01]
for stealing Boreabble heads.

[16:03]
I mean, how did I end up with all this responsibility?

[16:06]
Hey, I'm not screwing around here, small fry.

[16:08]
You better make those numbers sing.

[16:10]
I don't think these offshore banks we've been using

[16:13]
are 100% legal.

[16:14]
Yeah, well, my mother told me never to slap an idiot.

[16:17]
What? Ow!

[16:18]
Now we're both breaking the rules.

[16:20]
You listen, and you listen good.

[16:22]
I've gotten used to a certain lifestyle

[16:24]
since Boreanaz House went public,

[16:26]
and I'm not going back to the old way.

[16:27]
Mommy likes her shoes, see?

[16:29]
And her pearls.

[16:30]
Oh, I'm in too deep.

[16:32]
I don't know what to do.

[16:34]
[BoJack] I'll tell you what you should do.

[16:35]
Who said that?

[16:36]
It's me, David Boreanaz.

[16:38]
Is that what David Boreanaz sounds like?

[16:40]
Uh, sure.

[16:42]
Let me give you some advice.

[16:43]
As we say on my show-- I want to say, New Girl?--

[16:47]
just keep doing what you're doing, and you'll be fine.

[16:49]
Wow, thanks, Davie B.

[16:51]
Never call me that.

[16:56]
Unbelievable.

[16:57]
It's 4:00. I don't think anyone's coming.

[17:00]
Unbe-goddamn-lievable.

[17:02]
All those jerk wads had to do was show up,

[17:05]
and they couldn't even do that.

[17:07]
Where's the body even?

[17:08]
Beg your pardon, minor hiccup.

[17:11]
My goons went to pick your father up, but nobody was home.

[17:15]
For a nominal fee,

[17:16]
we can scrounge up another body for you.

[17:18]
Would you care to peruse our loaner closet?

[17:22]
[upbeat music]

[17:25]
Hey, assholes! Where were you?

[17:27]
I planned the whole funeral, like you asked me to,

[17:29]
and nobody showed.

[17:31]
Yeah, we realized dad wouldn't have wanted

[17:33]
some stuffy funeral.

[17:35]
He would've wanted his body to be chopped up into chum

[17:37]
and thrown in Derek Jeter's fat face.

[17:39]
Yeah, suck it, Jeter!

[17:41]
Wait, what? Where is Dad?

[17:42]
We got him chummed. He's in the truck.

[17:44]
[horn honks]

[17:46]
You chummed Dad?

[17:48]
It's what your father wanted, honey,

[17:50]
but then you wouldn't know anything about that, would you?

[17:53]
Let me get this straight.

[17:55]
So instead of coming to the funeral

[17:56]
that I paid for and spent all day organizing,

[17:59]
you had Dad's body ground into chum,

[18:02]
so you could throw his mushy remains on Derek Jeter?

[18:06]
No, not just on Derek Jeter.

[18:08]
We're gonna throw it into his fat face.

[18:10]
- Yeah, his fat face. - In his fat face.

[18:12]
The Yankees are in town this week.

[18:13]
The planets are aligning, Deedee.

[18:15]
Tommy, you begged me to stay and help.

[18:17]
Why does everything always got to be about big-shot Diane?

[18:21]
Too good for her home.

[18:23]
I don't think I'm too good for my home.

[18:25]
Yeah, guys, you got it all wrong.

[18:27]
Diane isn't a big-shot. She's my ghostwriter.

[18:30]
She's writing a book that's not even gonna have her name on it.

[18:34]
You think this is how she expected

[18:36]
her life would be going at 34?

[18:37]
She lives with her rich boyfriend and doesn't pay rent.

[18:41]
She's not too good for anything.

[18:44]
What?

[18:46]
Diane's a freeloader?

[18:47]
[laughter]

[18:48]
Even I pay rent.

[18:49]
BoJack helping?

[18:52]
[screams]

[18:56]
[glass breaking]

[18:57]
Whoa.

[18:59]
This is why I told you to wait in the car!

[19:03]
Oh, she snapped.

[19:05]
Here comes Cryane.

[19:06]
Hey, hey, Deedee, come on.

[19:09]
Diane, you are making a public spectacle of yourself.

[19:13]
Deedee, what are you doing with Dad's keys?

[19:15]
Put those back.

[19:17]
Oh, come on, that's Dad's truck.

[19:18]
- [screams] - Dad's chum is in the back.

[19:20]
No! No, no, no!

[19:21]
[Diane] Suck a dick, dumb shits!

[19:24]
Well, that crazy clam did it. She took Pops.

[19:26]
Oh, no, what are we gonna do?

[19:30]
[announcer] And it's a one-hopper back to the pitcher.

[19:32]
Easy out at first.

[19:33]
So what we're gonna do is nothing?

[19:36]
Sox are on, and I haven't seen this one.

[19:38]
Does anyone know where she might have gone?

[19:40]
Ah, she used to run off like this all the time

[19:42]
in high school, too.

[19:43]
Who knows where crazy goes?

[19:45]
I think I know where she went.

[19:47]
Wait, you can't leave.

[19:49]
The party's just getting started.

[19:51]
I don't know, Diane was pretty upset,

[19:53]
and she's got your dad.

[19:55]
Oh, don't go, BoJack.

[19:57]
You're like the fifth brother I never had.

[19:59]
I-- Really?

[20:00]
Yeah, don't leave, bro.

[20:01]
After this, we'll go play touch football

[20:03]
and do a noogie parade.

[20:04]
Ah, um...

[20:07]
[sirens blaring]

[20:08]
[cop] Everyone please disperse.

[20:09]
This is an unlawful gathering.

[20:11]
Disperse immediately.

[20:15]
Oh, this isn't looking good, Princess Carolyn.

[20:17]
What are we gonna do?

[20:18]
What do you mean, we?

[20:20]
Princess Carolyn always lands on her feet.

[20:22]
Ha!

[20:23]
Mr. Boreanaz, I presume.

[20:25]
Um, would you like a Boreabble head?

[20:29]
The amazing thing is,

[20:30]
the house looks just like BoJack's house.

[20:32]
They must have the same architect.

[20:34]
Anyway, how are things with you?

[20:36]
[Diane] Not good.

[20:37]
I should've known it was a waste of time

[20:39]
to come back here.

[20:40]
Oh, that's awful.

[20:41]
Well, when you get back,

[20:43]
I'll give you one of my patented Peanutbutter hugs.

[20:45]
Crunchy and creamy.

[20:47]
You know that patent wasn't approved,

[20:49]
but I'll take it.

[20:51]
I have to go. BoJack's here.

[20:53]
BoJack, well, what's he doing--?

[20:55]
Hey, sorry I said all that stuff about you.

[20:58]
It's all true, isn't it?

[21:01]
I found this letter back at the bar.

[21:02]
I think it's for you.

[21:06]
Look, just read it. I think you'll like it.

[21:08]
"Dear Diane, it's me, your old pen pal Leo.

[21:13]
This definitely isn't BoJack Horseman writing this."

[21:16]
Keep reading.

[21:17]
"You're a good person, Diane,

[21:19]
and that's the most important thing.

[21:22]
Even if no one appreciates you,

[21:24]
it's important that you don't stop being good.

[21:26]
I like how you always bring your own bags

[21:28]
to the grocery store,

[21:30]
and how you're always organized to go places.

[21:32]
I like how you chew gum on the airplane so your ears will pop.

[21:36]
A lot of people might not appreciate that about you,

[21:39]
but I do.

[21:41]
Yours forever, Leo."

[21:43]
That's the best letter he ever wrote me.

[21:46]
Look, take it from someone with his own shitty parents,

[21:49]
family is a sinkhole,

[21:51]
and you were right to get out when you had the chance.

[21:53]
The stupid thing is,

[21:54]
even now I still just want them to be proud of me

[21:56]
and think I did good.

[21:58]
Is that really stupid?

[22:00]
- Yep. - No, it isn't.

[22:01]
Yeah, it is.

[22:02]
You want those guys to be proud of you?

[22:04]
I guess I was just hoping to get some modicum of closure.

[22:06]
Closure is a made up thing

[22:08]
by Steven Spielberg to sell movie tickets.

[22:10]
It, like true love and the Munich Olympics,

[22:12]
doesn't exist in the real world.

[22:14]
The only thing to do now is just to keep living forward.

[22:18]
Yeah, but every time I come back here they--

[22:21]
So don't come back here.

[22:22]
What's great about Los Angeles

[22:24]
is nobody cares about where you're from or who you are.

[22:27]
It's a superficial town

[22:28]
where you can worry about stupid shit

[22:30]
like keeping your pool clean,

[22:31]
and what artisanal nuts to put on your salad.

[22:33]
I do like salad.

[22:34]
Oh, it's the best.

[22:36]
Why do you think people keep moving there?

[22:37]
Thanks, BoJack.

[22:39]
The good news is, your dad can't hurt anyone ever again.
