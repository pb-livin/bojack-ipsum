DIANE: Unbe-goddamn-lievable. All those jerk wads had to do was show up, and they couldn't even do that. Where's the body even?

[17:08]
FUNERAL DIRECTOR: Beg your pardon, minor hiccup. My goons went to pick your father up, but nobody was home. For a nominal fee, we can scrounge up another body for you. Would you care to peruse our loaner closet?

[17:22]
[upbeat music]

[17:25]
DIANE: Hey, assholes! Where were you? I planned the whole funeral, like you asked me to, and nobody showed.

[17:31]
TOMMY: Yeah, we realized dad wouldn't have wanted some stuffy funeral.

[17:35]
GARY: He would've wanted his body to be chopped up into chum and thrown in Derek Jeter's fat face.

[17:39]
ARTIE: Yeah, suck it, Jeter!

[17:41]
DIANE: Wait, what? Where is Dad?

[17:42]
TOMMY: We got him chummed. He's in the truck.

[17:44]
[horn honks]

[17:46]
DIANE: You chummed Dad?

[17:48]
DIANE'S MA: It's what your father wanted, honey, but then you wouldn't know anything about that, would you?

[17:53]
DIANE: Let me get this straight. So instead of coming to the funeral that I paid for and spent all day organizing, you had Dad's body ground into chum, so you could throw his mushy remains on Derek Jeter?

[18:06]
GARY: No, not just on Derek Jeter. We're gonna throw it into his fat face.

[18:10]
DIANE'S MA: Yeah, his fat face.

[18:11]
ARTIE: In his fat face.

[18:12]
TOMMY: The Yankees are in town this week. The planets are aligning, Deedee.

[18:15]
DIANE: Tommy, you begged me to stay and help.

[18:17]
DIANE'S MA: Why does everything always got to be about big-shot Diane? Too good for her home.

[18:23]
DIANE: I don't think I'm too good for my home.

[18:25]
BOJACK: Yeah, guys, you got it all wrong. Diane isn't a big-shot. She's my ghostwriter. She's writing a book that's not even gonna have her name on it. You think this is how she expected her life would be going at 34? She lives with her rich boyfriend and doesn't pay rent. She's not too good for anything.

[18:44]
TOMMY: What?

[18:46]
MARTY: Diane's a freeloader?

[18:47]
[laughter]

[18:48]
MARTY: Even I pay rent.

[18:49]
BOJACK: BoJack helping?

[18:52]
DIANE: [screams]

[18:56]
[glass breaking]

[18:57]
BOJACK: Whoa.

[18:59]
DIANE: This is why I told you to wait in the car!

[19:03]
GARY: Oh, she snapped. Here comes Cryane.

[19:06]
TOMMY: Hey, hey, Deedee, come on.

[19:09]
DIANE'S MA: Diane, you are making a public spectacle of yourself.

[19:13]
TOMMY: Deedee, what are you doing with Dad's keys? Put those back.

[19:17]
GARY: Oh, come on, that's Dad's truck.

[19:18]
DIANE: [screams]

[19:19]
GARY: Dad's chum is in the back. No! No, no, no!

[19:21]
DIANE: Suck a dick, dumb shits!

[19:24]
GARY: Well, that crazy clam did it. She took Pops.

[19:26]
MARTY: Oh, no, what are we gonna do?

[19:29]
[THREE MINUTES LATER]

[19:30]
ANNOUNCER: And it's a one-hopper back to the pitcher. Easy out at first.

[19:33]
BOJACK: So what we're gonna do is nothing?

[19:36]
MARTY: Sox are on, and I haven't seen this one.

[19:38]
BOJACK: Does anyone know where she might have gone?

[19:40]
ARTIE: Ah, she used to run off like this all the time in high school, too. Who knows where crazy goes?

[19:45]
BOJACK: I think I know where she went.

[19:47]
TOMMY: Wait, you can't leave. The party's just getting started.

[19:51]
BOJACK: I don't know, Diane was pretty upset, and she's got your dad.

[19:55]
GARY: Oh, don't go, BoJack. You're like the fifth brother I never had.

[19:59]
BOJACK: I-- Really?

[20:00]
TOMMY: Yeah, don't leave, bro. After this, we'll go play touch football and do a noogie parade.

[20:04]
BOJACK: Ah, um...

[20:07]
[sirens blaring]

[20:08]
COP: Everyone please disperse. This is an unlawful gathering. Disperse immediately.

[20:15]
TODD: Oh, this isn't looking good, Princess Carolyn. What are we gonna do?

[20:18]
CAROLYN: What do you mean, we? Princess Carolyn always lands on her feet. Ha!

[20:23]
COP: Mr. Boreanaz, I presume.

[20:25]
TODD: Um, would you like a Boreabble head?

[20:29]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: The amazing thing is, the house looks just like BoJack's house. They must have the same architect. Anyway, how are things with you?

[20:36]
DIANE: Not good. I should've known it was a waste of time to come back here.

[20:40]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, that's awful. Well, when you get back, I'll give you one of my patented Peanutbutter hugs. Crunchy and creamy.

[20:47]
DIANE: You know that patent wasn't approved, but I'll take it. I have to go. BoJack's here.

[20:53]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: BoJack, well, what's he doing--?

[20:55]
BOJACK: Hey, sorry I said all that stuff about you.

[20:58]
DIANE: It's all true, isn't it?

[21:01]
BOJACK: I found this letter back at the bar. I think it's for you. Look, just read it. I think you'll like it.

[21:08]
DIANE: "Dear Diane, it's me, your old pen pal Leo. This definitely isn't BoJack Horseman writing this."

[21:16]
BOJACK: Keep reading.

[21:17]
DIANE: "You're a good person, Diane, and that's the most important thing. Even if no one appreciates you, it's important that you don't stop being good. I like how you always bring your own bags to the grocery store, and how you're always organized to go places. I like how you chew gum on the airplane so your ears will pop. A lot of people might not appreciate that about you, but I do. Yours forever, Leo." That's the best letter he ever wrote me.

[21:46]
BOJACK: Look, take it from someone with his own shitty parents, family is a sinkhole, and you were right to get out when you had the chance.

[21:53]
DIANE: The stupid thing is, even now I still just want them to be proud of me and think I did good. Is that really stupid?

[21:59]
BOJACK: Yep.

[22:00]
DIANE: No, it isn't.

[22:01]
BOJACK: Yeah, it is. You want those guys to be proud of you?

[22:04]
DIANE: I guess I was just hoping to get some modicum of closure.

[22:06]
BOJACK: Closure is a made up thing by Steven Spielberg to sell movie tickets. It, like true love and the Munich Olympics, doesn't exist in the real world. The only thing to do now is just to keep living forward.

[22:18]
DIANE: Yeah, but every time I come back here they--

[22:21]
BOJACK: So don't come back here. What's great about Los Angeles is nobody cares about where you're from or who you are. It's a superficial town where you can worry about stupid shit like keeping your pool clean, and what artisanal nuts to put on your salad.

[22:33]
DIANE: I do like salad.

[22:34]
BOJACK: Oh, it's the best. Why do you think people keep moving there?

[22:37]
DIANE: Thanks, BoJack.

[22:39]
BOJACK: The good news is, your dad can't hurt anyone ever again. Uh-oh.
