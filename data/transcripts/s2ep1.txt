[Dick on TV] This is from BoJack H. BoJack is nine years old.

[00:08]
"When I grow up, I want to be like you. I'm on the right track.

[00:12]
Get it? Track? Because horses run on tracks and you are a horse.

[00:15]
And I am a horse. Do you get it? Do you get my joke about the track?"

[00:19]
- There's a whole page of this. - Should I write him, tell him I get it?

[00:23]
[Dick] He goes on. "My question for you is:

[00:25]
I am a good kid and I like to play,

[00:27]
and I like to go to school, but sometimes I get sad.

[00:30]
What do you do when you get sad? How do you not be sad?"

[00:33]
[mother] Oh, big stud, running off to gallivant with your fillies.

[00:36]
[plate smashes]

[00:37]
[father] Is that to impress me? I can smash a dinner plate, too.

[00:40]
[mother] That's a salad plate.

[00:42]
[father] I thought these were salad plates.

[00:44]
[mother] Those are saucers. [father] Why do we even have saucers?

[00:47]
We don't drink tea.

[00:49]
[mother] Those saucers are for entertaining!

[00:51]
[father] Oh, yeah? Well, I'm exit-taining.

[00:54]
Do you get it?

[00:56]
[door slams]

[00:57]
But, uh, seriously, folks. [chuckles] Right?

[01:00]
[mother groans]

[01:02]
Don't sit so close to the TV, it'll make you cruel.

[01:08]
You know, I was beautiful

[01:11]
- before I got pregnant. - I know.

[01:14]
- You ruined me, BoJack. - I know.

[01:18]
You better grow up to be something great to make up for all the damage you've done.

[01:22]
I will.

[01:24]
[man on TV] ...and I just kept running. BoJack...

[01:26]
Okay, enough me being a great mom.

[01:29]
I'm gonna go hide your father's heart medication.

Enjoy your dumb little TV show.

- BoJack, why did I wake up in an alley? - I had to get rid of the old couch, Todd.

[03:21]
While I was sleeping on it?

[03:22]
The couch was a metaphor for my old attitude.

[03:25]
My audiobook told me I had to let go of the burdens of my life sofa.

[03:29]
Oh, you know what? Maybe it was "my life so far."

[03:31]
I feel like you could've woken me up first.

[03:33]
Todd, no one can wake anybody else up. You need to wake yourself up.

[03:38]
I don't know if I trust this new guy. I'm just gonna go sleep in your car.

[04:31]
I gotta go. One of my dumb-ass clients is here.

[04:34]
Just out for a jog, thought I'd say hello. I jog now.

[04:37]
You jogged here from Laurel Canyon?

[04:39]
I drove, but I moved my arm a bunch, so the Fitbit counted the miles.

[04:42]
Uh, someone named BoJark Hoseman is here?

[04:46]
- Thank you, Stuart. - Also, your coffee is coming late.

[04:49]
- Just like you ordered. - I said "latte."

Ah. Well, I wrote down "late," so that's what it's gonna be.

This Secretariat movie is a big deal.

Please do not blow it.

Why would I blow it? I have a brand-new attitude.

[05:25]
You know, when I won that Golden Globe last month, I went to a very dark place.

[05:29]
I was in a hole.

[05:30]
And I realized, "I can wallow in this hole or I can change."

[05:34]
While I was tempted to go with the former, sometimes the only way out of a hole

[05:38]
is a latter.

[05:39]
- No pun intended. - You clearly intended that pun.

[05:42]
Princess Carolyn, you gotta believe in the AHP of TPE.

[05:46]
Huh.

[05:47]
- Uh-uh. I'm not asking. - The awesome healing power--

[05:50]
- I am not asking. - --of total positive energy.

[05:52]
You should leave because I'm about to pretend to get a phone call.

[05:55]
Hello? [chuckles] No, he's still here.

[05:58]
- No, he's not taking the hint somehow. - Mm-hm.

[Mr. Peanutbutter] Honey, where's my bandana?

[06:06]
You chewed it up, we had to throw it away, remember?

[06:08]
[Mr. Peanutbutter] No, not that one.

[06:11]
The one with the bones on it.

[06:12]
With the meat juice stains? The one I wore to the Emmys.

[06:15]
I don't know. I gotta go. BoJack's gonna be here any minute.

[06:18]
Did you check the hall closet?

[06:20]
[Mr. Peanutbutter] I can't see anything in this stupid thing.

[06:23]
I know, Mr. Peanutbutter.

[06:25]
But you gotta keep it on for one more week.

- [thudding] - [Mr. Peanutbutter grunting]

You look very responsible.

[06:51]
I don't know because I have no peripheral vision. Going off of smell here.

[06:55]
Mr. Peanutbutter, how the hell are you?

[06:57]
- Loving it, buddy. Loving life. - Brother, I am right there with you.

[07:01]
I got a brand-new attitude and I am also loving life.

[07:03]
Uh...

[07:04]
Diane, look at us. A couple life-lovers over here.

[07:07]
- Uh... - Is that a new cone? Looking sharp, PB.

[07:10]
It is a new cone. Is it obvious I'm wearing a cone?

[07:13]
Didn't notice. You've got the smile of a winner.

[07:15]
- What's going on? - I have to wear the cone

[07:18]
so I don't gnaw on the stitches I had to get when I punched a mirror last week.

[07:22]
I got drunk and thought my reflection was another dog. [chuckles]

[07:25]
I was so mad at that other dog.

[07:28]
He was wearing my clothes.

[07:29]
- We've all been there. - I don't understand what's happening.

[07:32]
Did someone say something to the left? Diane, is that you?

[07:35]
Hey, why don't we just us two schedj a hang for this 'kend?

[07:38]
"'Kend" is how I say weekend now.

[07:40]
Uh, I love that. And I got a pair of tix to the 'Stones show this 'kend.

[07:44]
- Wanna go? - The Rolling Stones?

[07:46]
What? Oh, no, no, no. The Mighty Mighty Bosstones.

[07:50]
I'm not really familiar with that outfit, but I do love trying new things.

[07:54]
- Who are you? - Anyway, we gotta get to work.

[07:56]
It was really great talking to you, Mr. Peanutbutter.

[07:59]
All right, break a leg, good buddy. Diane, BoJack's ready to go.

[08:04]
Where are you, sweetheart? Are you ready?

[08:06]
[man on recording] The house is a metaphor for a home.

[08:09]
Happiness is a metaphor for change.

[08:12]
Happiness is a metaphor--

[08:14]
- Where are we going? - Oh, my God.

[08:21]
BoJack, this is Corduroy Jackson-Jackson, your costar.

[08:25]
- Hey, man. - Corduroy Jackson-Jackson.

[08:28]
Oh, right, the underwear guy.

[08:29]
Underwear model/actor/dancer/dreamer. [chuckles]

[08:35]
Also, you know, I'm a huge fan. I'm so excited/amped/pumped

[08:39]
to be working with you. [chuckles] Yeah.

[08:41]
Hey, man, that's fantastic/great/I-ran-out-of-things.

[08:45]
- Hi. Kelsey Jannings? - That depends.

[08:48]
- Are you my ex-wife's lawyer? - I'm Diane.

[08:51]
I'm here to be a character consultant.

[08:53]
- What? - I got a call from the studio.

[08:55]
Okay. Why don't you stand over there and make sure no one trips over that cable?

[09:00]
- This cable? - Do you have a thousand dollars?

[09:02]
- What? - Because each minute

[09:04]
I spend talking to you, that's how much money I'm wasting.

[09:07]
- Oh. Sorry. - Hey, who's this guy?

[09:08]
- Who let this guy in? - I just--

[09:10]
He's got a funny face. I like your face.

[09:12]
- Thank you. - What a cute funny face. Cookie?

[09:14]
Can someone get this guy a cookie?

[09:16]
He's got a soothing face and I like looking at it.

[09:18]
- Like a Matisse painting. - Whoa.

[09:20]
Guys, could I get everyone's attention, please?

[09:22]
Oh, watch out for the cable. Don't trip over the cable.

[09:25]
I just want everyone to know what an honor it is to be here.

[09:28]
Secretariat has always been a personal hero of mine.

[09:31]
A complex role that requires a precise touch and a deft hand

[09:35]
and I just can't wait to tackle it head-on.

[09:37]
It's truly an honor.

[09:39]
Namaste.

[09:43]
Neat. So, in this scene, Secretariat's at his lowest.

[09:46]
He just lost his first race, his father was sent to the glue factory.

[09:50]
It's a dark moment.

[09:52]
- You got it. - Scene 22 alpha, take one.

[09:56]
[inhales, then exhales]

[09:57]
- [Kelsey] Action! - Hey, Secretariat.

[10:04]
[campy] What are you doing here?

[10:09]
[chuckles]

[10:10]
[mumbles, then chuckles]

[10:13]
[Kelsey groans]

[10:14]
[phone buzzing]

[10:17]
- Hello? - Diane!

[10:19]
I can't tell you how disappointed I am

[10:22]
you're not here with me in Northern Cordovia.

[10:25]
I'm incredibly disappointed. Boo!

[10:27]
I didn't think I could do it, but I did it.

[10:30]
I'm amazing.

[10:32]
Sebastian, I know you're doing important work.

[10:34]
I couldn't just drop everything and fly to the Third World.

[10:37]
- I just got married, and-- - [Sebastian] Diane.

[10:39]
People are dying, and I'm witnessing it.

[10:41]
And I need people to witness me witnessing it.

[10:45]
I know, and I'll be there in three months, as soon as I'm done on the movie.

[10:49]
This is also important.

[10:51]
In a way.

[10:52]
Well, lucky for you, there'll still be just as much famine

[10:55]
and war and devastation in three months.

[10:58]
I'm not dead yet.

[11:00]
- Yep. Lucky me. - [man] We're still rolling, people.

[11:03]
So, BoJack, in this scene, Secretariat is sad, right?

[11:07]
Afraid he's gonna lose his scholarship.

[11:09]
Oh, sure. Yeah, sad. Of course. Duh. [chuckles]

[11:11]
Okay, here we go. Action.

[11:14]
Hey, Secretariat.

[11:15]
[campy] What are you doing here?

[11:19]
That was bad. I know that was bad. Let's keep it rolling.

[11:21]
- I'll say when to keep rolling. - Okay.

[11:23]
What are you doing here? Did we get it? I can tell by your face that we didn't.

[11:28]
All right, let me try again. What are you doing--?

[11:30]
I am having trouble with the words. Is it okay if I play around with it a bit?

[11:34]
When did you get here? Sorry, no. Got it. Got it. Got it.

[11:38]
Man, these lights are bright, huh?

[11:40]
Can we kill these lights at all? Is that a--?

[11:42]
- No. - Okay, I'm sad.

[11:44]
I'm sad. Acting sad.

[11:46]
Secretariat is sad.

[11:48]
Okay, here we go.

[11:49]
I'm sad!

[11:51]
Sorry, what was the line?

[11:53]
I don't know if this helps or not, but when Secretariat was a kid

[11:56]
- he actually-- - Aah!

[11:58]
- My face! - [man 1] Hey, hey.

[11:59]
- Whoa, whoa! - [man 2] Oh, my God.

[12:01]
[man 3] Watch out! [man 4] Hey.

[12:03]
[man 5 gasps] [man 6] Whoa, whoa!

[12:05]
[PA] Oh, my God. My face.

[12:07]
My beautiful face.

[12:09]
Why didn't someone tell me not to trip over that cable?

[12:13]
It was such an important job, but no one was there to do it

[12:17]
and now my face is in ruins.

[12:19]
We're gonna need a couple of days to rebuild this set.

[12:22]
So, let's all just use this time to regroup

[12:25]
and really figure out what we're doing

[12:29]
and why we're here.

[12:32]
[audience laughing]

[12:37]
So, let me get this straight. Bad means good?

[12:41]
Maybe you should leave the teen-talk to me. Jeezy Kableezy.

[12:45]
[audience laughing]

[12:50]
Well, it wasn't Ibsen.

[12:52]
That's your takeaway? That your son's TV show wasn't Ibsen?

[12:56]
I'm sorry. Did you need a compliment?

[12:58]
Oh, I loved the part where you got your head caught in the banister.

[13:02]
- Yeah-- - And what's this letter I have?

[13:04]
It's from the government saying, "I'm proud of you."

[13:07]
- Are you--? - No, what I'm holding is nothing.

[13:10]
Can you check on our drinks? I would love some gin.

[13:13]
I wouldn't drink anything out of an open container. This town is full of AIDS.

[13:17]
- That's not-- - You're a clown, you know that?

[13:19]
You've always been a pillar of support.

[13:21]
Gin, please? Is there gin coming?

[13:23]
I'm here, aren't I? I suffered through that ordeal.

[13:25]
You know, the man sitting next to me was wearing a T-shirt?

[13:28]
A T-shirt, BoJack, in the theater.

[13:31]
Yes, a T-shirt.

[13:32]
Worst thing that's happened to anyone in a theater.

[13:35]
- The T-shirt told me to "just do it." - Here we go.

[13:38]
I don't know to what "it" the T-shirt referred

[13:41]
but I won't be spoken to in that tone by an article of clothing.

[13:44]
Vodka? Triple sec? Looking for any alcohol.

[13:46]
You don't know how lucky you are.

[13:48]
I hope you die before I do so you never know what it's like to lose a mother.

[13:52]
As long as one of us dies, that's good enough.

[13:54]
Can we please get some alcohol into my mouth?

[13:59]
[man on recording] The past is past.

[14:01]
That's why it's called the past.

[14:04]
Tomorrow is an opportunity.

[14:06]
You can be big and proud and bang on your tom-tom drum

[14:10]
or you can get in your boat and row.

[14:14]
Tom or row.

[14:16]
Tomorrow.

[14:17]
- Hey, do you wanna talk? - Talk? Why? Why would we do that?

[14:20]
So you can put everything in a book and sell a million copies?

[14:23]
Wow. Uh...

[14:25]
That's what the old me would have said. The new me doesn't hold a grudge.

[14:28]
[phone rings]

[14:28]
- No. - I gotta say,

[14:30]
the new you seems a little on edge.

[14:33]
What? Me? I'm as cool as The Fonz in a meat locker.

[14:35]
That's a metaphor, Diane.

[14:37]
- It's a simile. - Goddamn it.

[14:39]
[phone rings]

[14:40]
Oh, okay. Hello?

[14:41]
Small talk, small talk, small talk. Are you blowing it?

[14:44]
- I heard you're blowing it. - What? Who told you that? Was it Todd?

[14:48]
You gotta turn this ship around, BoJ. If you don't--

[14:50]
Hey, can you hold on a second? I'm getting another call.

[14:53]
Well, if it isn't my friend, Rutabaga, the boy prince of the [00:00]h floor.

[14:58]
Carolyn. How are things all the way up on 27?

[15:02]
Stomp once for good, twice for killing it.

[15:06]
Killing...

[15:08]
Give me some gossip.

[15:10]
My wife is making me go to the opera tonight.

[15:12]
I need something to distract me from the thought of D-bags

[15:15]
singing songs in German about their boners.

[15:18]
Okay, you gotta keep this close to the vest

[15:20]
but I am inches from getting Emily VanCamp

[15:23]
the lead in Goose Van Sant's new movie about Jackie O.

[15:27]
My clients would f-l-ip if I got them parts like that.

[15:32]
You're killing it in the department of kicking ass

[15:35]
in regards to you being an agent and being good at it, crushing it.

[15:38]
You're not so bad yourself, Rutabaga, for a 26er. [chuckles]

[15:41]
You're the only one in this building who isn't a total snooze-cooze.

[15:45]
Yes, Natasha, I'm talking about you. I know you're listening.

[15:49]
Ugh. I gotta go. I made Natasha cry.

[15:52]
[chuckles]

[15:54]
I don't think she's coming back.

[15:56]
Could we keep it down in the front, please?

[15:59]
- Thank you. - What am I gonna do?

[16:01]
Well, you were an actor for nine years on Horsin' Around. How did you do that?

[16:06]
Uh...

[16:07]
- Hey, can I talk to you for a minute? - Of course, buddy.

[16:10]
I always have time for you, my good friend BoJack

[16:13]
in this, the year 1988.

[16:15]
Have a seat.

[16:16]
[stomping overhead]

[16:17]
Hey, enough with the stomping already!

[16:21]
- Am I-- Am I a clown? - Oh, brother.

[16:25]
Didn't I tell you not to invite your mom to the taping?

[16:27]
As Max Headroom would say, "Your m-m-mom is a b-b-bitch." [chuckles]

[16:32]
But I am a good actor, right?

[16:34]
BJ, I don't know. Look-- You know what you're good at?

[16:38]
Hitting your mark, saying your lines, loudly with good diction.

[16:42]
Should I be doing more? To capture the character

[16:44]
- and make the audience connect? - This is a situation comedy.

[16:48]
No one watches this show to feel feelings. Life is depressing enough already.

[16:52]
You bring joy to millions of people.

[16:54]
Maybe someday later, you'll need to learn how to act for real.

[16:58]
But for now, [chuckles] don't worry about it.

[17:02]
Oh, shit. I'm not an actor.

[17:06]
All this time, I assumed there was more to me than everyone thought

[17:09]
but maybe there isn't.

[17:12]
That's the part where you're supposed to disagree with me.

[17:14]
Oh, right.

[17:16]
Well, you got the part, didn't you? What did you do in the audition?

[17:20]
Well, how should I know? That was the old me.

[17:22]
Now I've got a brand-new attitude.

[17:25]
Oh, God. Okay. Okay. What should I do?

[17:28]
Make a break for it? Drive to Mexico?

[17:30]
Start a new life there? Meet a local girl? Fall in love?

[17:33]
Talk my way into a job at a textile plant?

[17:35]
Work my way up until I own the place?

[17:37]
What am I talking about? I can't run a textile plant.

[17:39]
Too much responsibility. What am I gonna do? The walls are closing in!

[17:43]
BoJack, breathe. You can do this.

[17:46]
You have two days. Maybe you could hire an acting coach.

[17:49]
- Yeah? - Yeah.

[17:50]
Plus, you can watch old Secretariat videos.

[17:53]
I've got a hard drive full of research.

[17:55]
Yeah. Yeah, you're right. You're right. I can do this.

[17:58]
I've got two whole days.

[18:00]
And when the pressure's on, that's when I shine.

[18:03]
Yeah. Two days. I can do all those things.

[18:08]
Oh, shit. I didn't do any of those things.

[18:14]
- What are you doing here? - Ah!

[18:16]
That was it. Say that again.

[18:18]
[campy] What are you doing here?

[18:20]
- Okay. - No?

[18:21]
BoJack, before we get started

[18:23]
- I wanted to show you this. - What?

[18:25]
This is the machine that's gonna make you a good actor.

[18:27]
- Really? - No. We need to make a scan of your face

[18:30]
so that if you die, we can finish the movie.

[18:33]
Standard procedure. When a star is assessed to be of a certain liability,

[18:37]
like if there was a whole book written about what a reckless jackass he is,

[18:41]
you make a digital replica so you're not screwed if he goes all Belushi on you.

[18:45]
- Wait, which Belushi? - Hold still, please.

[18:48]
[whirring]

[18:50]
- Terrific. We got it. - One day, that's gonna be the job.

[18:53]
Sit for five seconds while a machine scans his face.

[18:56]
Six months later, plugging a movie on Kimmel.

[18:58]
I gotta go on Kimmel now? What if he makes me read a mean tweet?

[19:01]
I'm not emotionally prepared.

[19:03]
Don't worry so much. If you can't do this part

[19:05]
we'll just fire you and get someone else who can. Either way, I'll be fine.

[19:10]
- [groans] - What do you need, BoJack?

[19:12]
I don't know. I thought I wanted this, but now I'm feeling all this pressure.

[19:16]
- Think you made a mistake, hiring me? - I don't make mistakes, BoJack.

[19:20]
I do the crossword in Sharpie, I never learned the shortcut for undo.

[19:23]
- Command-Z. - Don't need it, won't use it.

[19:26]
I'm trying to have this new attitude, be this better, more positive guy.

[19:30]
I keep thinking about how this movie is my last shot at happiness.

[19:33]
Well, BoJack, I hope this helps:

[19:35]
I don't care if you are happy or not.

[19:39]
You have a job to do.

[19:40]
[Kelsey chuckles]

[19:42]
This guy again? I'm in love with this kid. I wanna put you in my pocket. [grunts]

[19:46]
- You're adorable. - Aw.

[19:49]
[man sobbing]

[19:51]
- Hey, Diane, you're a writer, aren't you? - Yes.

[19:53]
Yes. I am a writer. What do you need?

[19:56]
Can you write on a sign "watch out for cable"?

[19:59]
You were telling people, but it's a really important job

[20:01]
and a sign is less likely to get distracted.

[20:04]
Oh. Yeah. Okay.

[20:07]
What are you doing here?

[20:09]
What are you doing here?

[20:10]
What are you doing here?

[20:12]
- What are you doing here? - So, I went a little overboard

[20:15]
and I made you two mixes.

[20:17]
The first CD is all Mighty Mighty.

[20:19]
The second CD is all of the Bosstones' side projects and solo singles.

[20:22]
Listen to it and imagine the band never took that hiatus

[20:25]
in the mid-aughts when America briefly lost interest in ska.

[20:28]
I don't have time. I don't wanna listen to your music.

[20:31]
I don't wanna hang out. Get out of here.

[20:33]
[Mr. Peanutbutter chuckles]

[20:34]
All right. You don't wanna listen to Bosstones together.

[20:37]
That's the impression that I get.

[20:39]
- Is it the impression that I get? - Yes. That's the impression that you get.

[20:43]
[Todd yawns]

[20:44]
I see. Way to go, Mr. Peanutbutter. What a stupid move. Why did you--?

[20:48]
[snarling]

[20:51]
[BoJack groans]

[20:52]
BoJack, listen, I know you're scared, but it's gonna be okay.

[20:57]
- You gotta be strong. - Yeah, but--

[20:59]
You gotta rise to the occasion, okay? So what if the new couch is weird?

[21:03]
- Or lumpy? - Uh, what?

[21:05]
What are you gonna do? Just sleep in BoJack's car forever?

[21:08]
- Are you talking to me, or you--? - Damn it, time to stop being a coward.

[21:12]
It's time to go home and sleep on BoJack's couch. Hurray!

[21:18]
Happy ending for Todd!

[21:20]
[sighs]

[21:27]
- [phone rings] - [Charley gasps and grunts]

[21:30]
Charley Witherspoon, [00:00]h floor agent.

[21:33]
Charley. Listen, I wanted to touch base about Emily's start date on Jackie O.

[21:37]
Oh, yeah. Uh...

[21:39]
Well, we got some new screen tests

[21:42]
and, uh, Goose decided to go in a different direction.

[21:46]
Are you saying the Van Sant camp wants to recant on VanCamp?

[21:49]
Because they can't.

[21:51]
Uh...

[21:52]
Charley, you better get your client to change his mind

[21:54]
- or I'll walk up to the [00:00]h floor and-- - Just kidding.

[21:58]
- I can't get to the phone right now. - What?

[22:01]
This is one of those answering machines that sounds like it's Charley talking

[22:06]
but it's actually just an answering machine.

[22:08]
- I know you're there, Charley. - Leave a message.

[22:11]
- I'm not gonna leave a message. - Beep.

[22:13]
Hey, Charley, Princess Carolyn again. Listen--

[22:15]
- Mailbox is full. - What? Mailbox full?

[22:18]
- Error. Message deleted. - Wait-- No--

[22:20]
Gotta go. Bye.

[22:22]
[grunting]

[22:24]
[phone rings]

[22:26]
[Rutabaga over phone] Carolyn.

[22:28]
Rutabaga, this is not a good time.

[22:30]
Okay. Can I please just tell you about the opera, though?

[22:33]
[groans]

[22:34]
- How did you like the opera? - I loved it.

[22:37]
Loved Tristan, loved Isolde, cried like a bunny.

[22:40]
Listen, my brain has been a-buzzing

[22:42]
for the past few days thinking about that Jackie O movie.

[22:45]
I know it's your baby, but I did make a few calls

[22:48]
and got my Rooney a screen test.

[22:50]
I put that movie together for my client.

[22:52]
No, no, no, don't freak out. It's just a screen test.

[22:55]
But, honestly, how fantaj would my Rooney be

[22:58]
as a young Jackie Bouv?

[22:59]
Stomp once for so fantaj, twice for stupid-fantaj.

[23:04]
Carolyn? I only heard one stomp.

[23:08]
Oh. Carolyn, I heart you. You're beautiful.

[23:10]
I wish I met you before I got married.

[23:12]
[groans]

[23:13]
[man on recording] You can do it.

[23:15]
Only you hold the keys to the house that is you.

[23:18]
The house is at the top of a hill.

[23:21]
The hill is also you.

[23:23]
[knock on door]

[23:24]
Five minutes, Mr. Horseman.

[23:25]
[man on recording] When you get your new attitude,

[23:28]
you're gonna wave goodbye to the old--

[23:31]
[phone ringing]

[23:34]
[groans]

[23:35]
What do you want, Mom?

[23:36]
Look who finally decided to pick up the phone.

[23:39]
- Do you need more blood? - I don't need blood.

[23:42]
- I read your book, BoJack. - Oh.

[23:45]
It takes a real narcissist to think anyone wants to buy a book about him.

[23:48]
You know how I feel about Anne Frank.

[23:50]
- That was a diary. - I read the parts about me.

[23:53]
The things I said to you.

[23:56]
You must think I'm a real monster.

[23:59]
- Mom-- - I don't wanna fight you, BoJack.

[24:01]
I just wanted to tell you I know.

[24:04]
I know you wanna be happy, but you won't be, and--

[24:09]
- I'm sorry. - What?

[24:11]
It's not just you, you know.

[24:13]
Your father and I, we--

[24:15]
Well, you come by it honestly, the ugliness inside you.

[24:21]
You were born broken, that's your birthright.

[24:24]
And now you can fill your life with projects

[24:28]
your books and your movies and your little girlfriends

[24:31]
but it won't make you whole.

[24:34]
You're BoJack Horseman.

[24:36]
There's no cure for that.

[24:40]
Anyway, do you remember who directed The Philadelphia Story?

[24:44]
Five letters, second letter U?

[24:47]
- Lubitsch? - [sighs] No, BoJack. Goodbye.

[24:51]
[call disconnects]

[24:53]
[man on recording] You need to visualize it

[24:55]
flying out the window, over the--

[25:05]
What are you doing here?

[25:07]
[Kelsey] Great. We got it. Let's move on.
