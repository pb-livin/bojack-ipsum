[00:08]
We're very different, but I think that we bring out

[00:10]
the best in each other.

[00:12]
It's like you're chocolate and I'm Mr. Peanutbutter.

[00:15]
Shut up and kiss me, you silly goof.

[00:21]
- Cut! - [buzzer sounds]

[00:25]
Welcome back to Excess Hollywoo.

[00:27]
I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type, and I'm visiting the set

[00:30]
of Mr. Peanutbutter's Hollywoo Heist.

[00:32]
I'm thrilled to be talking to the star of the film,

[00:35]
BoJack Horseman, and his real life inspiration,

[00:38]
Mr. Peanutbutter.

[00:39]
Am I an inspiration?

[00:41]
Well, that depends on how you define--

[00:43]
- Wait a minute. Yes, I am. - Ugh.

[00:45]
You know, I'm just over the moon to be producing

[00:47]
this movie about my daring exploit.

[00:50]
- Yes, your daring exploit. - Yes.

[00:53]
It's such a treat to be shooting in my very own casa.

[00:55]
And it's an even sweeter treat to be played by my good amigo--

[00:59]
dare I say best amigo?

[01:01]
- You "daren't." - We're so in tune.

[01:03]
We even finish each other's...

[01:08]
sentences.

[01:09]
Sometimes it doesn't happen.

[01:11]
- It never-- - Happens.

[01:12]
Ah, see? I'm inside him.

[01:15]
BoJack, you haven't worked in quite some time.

[01:17]
In fact, I thought you were dead.

[01:19]
You must be so grateful to be working again and also alive,

[01:22]
which, again, I thought you were not.

[01:24]
How did you get involved with this?

[01:25]
Well--

[01:27]
You want me to play Mr. Peanutbutter

[01:28]
in the story he stole from me?

[01:31]
I stole the D,

[01:32]
and then he stole my stealing of it.

[01:34]
That makes him an idea thief, which is much less cool

[01:36]
than a thief thief, which is what I am

[01:38]
and what he also is.

[01:40]
You know what might help?

[01:41]
If you think about this like a professional

[01:42]
instead of a big titty baby.

[01:44]
This movie is a huge opportunity.

[01:46]
Quentin Tarantulino is known for revitalizing dead careers.

[01:50]
This could do for you what Reservoir Dogs

[01:52]
did for Rin Tin Tin.

[01:53]
But isn't there any other part?

[01:55]
I could play myself.

[01:56]
No, BoJack's already being played by Wallace Shawn.

[01:59]
What? The short guy from The Princess Bride

[02:00]
who says "inconceivable"?

[02:02]
- Why Wallace Shawn? - BoJack Horseman?

[02:04]
I don't want to play that boob.

[02:05]
I'm trying to help you out, Wally.

[02:07]
You're the one who keeps buying expensive Rothkos.

[02:10]
I have a disease.

[02:11]
Would you tell an alcoholic to stop buying alcohol?

[02:15]
You know, Black and Blue Number 7's

[02:17]
going up for auction next week.

[02:18]
Fine. I'll do the dumb movie.

[02:20]
Fine. I'll do the dumb movie.

[02:22]
But if you find me in a bathtub with open wrists tomorrow

[02:24]
and the words "I hate my agent" smeared across the walls

[02:26]
in blood, you'll know why.

[02:28]
So obviously I'm thrilled to be here, just thrilled.

[02:32]

Cast and crew only.

[03:28]
I know you're just doing your job,

[03:30]
but I live here, and the crew has been here since 3:00 a.m.,

[03:34]
so I'm a little tired.

[03:35]
Cast and crew only.

[03:37]
Hey, stranger.

[03:39]
Haven't really seen you since the wedding.

[03:41]
Kind of feels like we're coming back to school

[03:42]
- after summer vacation. - Yeah.

[03:44]
I'll see you at the pep rally.

[03:45]
Hope we don't get Mrs. Kirkman for trig this year.

[03:47]
Yeah, well, I hope the cheerleaders don't stuff me

[03:50]
in a locker and write "virgin slut" on my forehead,

[03:52]
and then when I ask how I could be both a virgin

[03:54]
and a slut, they make me eat a lipstick.

[03:56]
Uh...

[03:58]
So what have you been up to these last couple months?

[04:00]
Well, I've been pretty busy. Met a girl at Soho House.

[04:03]
- Was she your waitress? - Yes.

[04:04]
Then I met a girl at Mastro's.

[04:06]
- Was she also your waitress? - Yes.

[04:08]
Then I met a girl at P.F. Chang's.

[04:09]
Let me guess. She was your--

[04:10]
A hooker, yes, but what she really wants to do

[04:12]
- is wait tables. - [laughs]

[04:14]
Well, I, for one, would love to meet

[04:16]
the aspiring food-service worker

[04:18]
who finally gets you to settle down.

[04:19]
What? Why would I want to settle down?

[04:22]
I'm 50.

[04:24]
- Yeah, anyway... - So I'm sending the first draft

[04:26]
of the book to Pinky this afternoon.

[04:28]
- What? It's done? - Not yet. Almost.

[04:30]
I'm excited for you to read it,

[04:33]
but I'm also cripplingly nervous.

[04:35]
I actually kind of feel like throwing up,

[04:37]
but I can't throw up because I haven't had anything to eat

[04:39]
because this lady won't let me in my own kitchen.

[04:41]
Cast and crew only.

[04:43]
Listen, if reading a book you wrote is anywhere near

[04:45]
as great as it is to actually spend time with you,

[04:47]
I'm sure it's gonna be wonderful.

[04:49]
Having said that, what do I know about books?

[04:51]
I'm just a dumb actor.

[04:55]
I'm here with Hollywoo darling Naomi Watts.

[04:59]
Tell me, what attracted you to the role of Diane?

[05:01]
I just keep getting pigeonholed

[05:03]
as these complex characters in highly acclaimed movies.

[05:05]
For once, I would just love to phone it in

[05:07]
and play a two-dimensional girl in a rom com

[05:09]
with no inner life of her own.

[05:11]
That's kind of the reason I got into this business.

[05:14]
Ha ha! You said words.

[05:16]
Now, is it true you stay in character between takes?

[05:19]
Oh, we all do. The director insists upon it.

[05:22]
He even has everyone calling me Diane

[05:24]
to help me get in the headspace.

[05:26]
It's been great.

[05:28]
Diane, looking good.

[05:29]
- Um, thanks. - Ugh, not you.

[05:31]
I was talking to Diane.

[05:32]
Oh, thank you.

[05:34]
Now, where's my peanut butter?

[05:35]
Right over here, Q.

[05:36]
No, I'm looking for peanut butter.

[05:37]
Oh, you mean BoJack?

[05:39]
If I wanted BoJack, I would call BoJack.

[05:41]
Did someone call for BoJack?

[05:43]
It really cuts down on confusion.

[05:48]
Ah, show business, the great equalizer.

[05:51]
Is that what it is?

[05:53]
Todd, spritz me.

[05:55]
- Spritzing. - Mm, mm, mm.

[05:57]
Well spritzed.

[05:59]
Have you ever been on a movie set before?

[06:00]
No, sir, Mr. Peanutbutter.

[06:02]
Please, Mr. Peanutbutter was my father's name.

[06:06]
- Uh-- - And it's also my name!

[06:08]
[buzzer sounds]

[06:09]
Ooh, speaking of Mr. Peanutbutter,

[06:11]
I'll be back in a jiff, skippy.

[06:12]
Keep that air spritzed for me.

[06:15]
Aloha, kemosabe.

[06:16]
Hey, allow me to put on my producer hat

[06:19]
and produce you just for one second here.

[06:21]
I have a few notes on how you're playing me.

[06:24]
Let's see. [humming]

[06:26]
Problems, problems, problems, ah, here we go.

[06:28]
I find it really troubling that my movie self

[06:31]
is wearing a crew neck T-shirt. [laughs]

[06:33]
I only wear V-necks.

[06:35]
You see the problem.

[06:36]
- I do not. - I just think if we're telling

[06:38]
the story, we should tell it how it really happened.

[06:40]
Yeah, this whole story isn't how it really happened.

[06:42]
Right...

[06:44]
because of the shirts.

[06:46]
Because I'm the one who stole the D.

[06:47]
I'm the real hero here.

[06:49]
My life is full of exciting adventures.

[06:50]
I should write a book.

[06:51]
Oh, wait. I did.

[06:53]
Suck on that, society.

[06:55]
Hey, you're in a mood.

[06:56]
Perhaps the tightness of that crew neck

[06:58]
is cutting off circulation to the brain?

[07:00]
Let me talk to Donna in wardrobe.

[07:02]
We're gonna fix this, buddy.

[07:03]
Donna!

[07:08]
What are you doing?

[07:09]
I'm just trying to get inside my character, which is you.

[07:12]
Is this how we move our arms?

[07:14]
We're so weird.

[07:15]
Is this really necessary?

[07:17]
Is this really necessary?

[07:18]
That's not what I sound like.

[07:19]
That's not mut mi sound mike.

[07:21]
Hey, what's it been like since we got married?

[07:23]
Is it everything we dreamed of since we were little?

[07:26]
When I was little, I dreamed of getting

[07:28]
a MacArthur grant for my 'zine about how all the girls

[07:30]
at school were bitches.

[07:31]
- Oh. - Look, the wedding was great.

[07:34]
But that's not real life.

[07:36]
I mean, I guess I got a happy ending,

[07:37]
but every happy ending has the day after

[07:39]
the happy ending, right?

[07:41]
And the day after that.

[07:42]
So the wedding was so much fun.

[07:44]
It was the happiest day of my life.

[07:46]
But, you know, what does that say

[07:47]
about all the days I have left?

[07:49]
Whoa.

[07:51]
We're such a Zoe.

[07:55]
Oh, Todd, glad you're here.

[07:57]
Hold this.

[07:58]
Todd, my jacket is on the floor.

[08:00]
You're supposed to hold the jacket

[08:01]
so it doesn't go on the floor.

[08:03]
Hey, sorry, BoJack-- I mean, uh, Mr. Peanutbutter.

[08:06]
But I work for Mr. Peanutbutter now.

[08:08]
- I mean, uh, Mr. Peanutbutter. - Ugh.

[08:11]
I can't believe I'm on a movie set, you know?

[08:13]
I mean, this is my first chance to work on something big

[08:16]
since my rock opera fell apart.

[08:18]
Man, I really messed up that huge career opportunity

[08:22]
all on my own, didn't I?

[08:23]
Uh...

[08:24]
Nothing sabotaged me one bit.

[08:30]
Yep.

[08:31]
You said it.

[08:32]
Well, see you later.

[08:34]
[indistinct chatter]

[08:36]
Where can I grab a nosh?

[08:38]
Oh, craft services is in the kitchen.

[08:40]
Up the driveway, through the living room, make a left.

[08:42]
- Can't miss it. - I'm gonna grab a quick bite.

[08:44]
Don't do anything stupid while I'm gone.

[08:47]
Okay, fellas, here's the thing about the story.

[08:49]
I don't buy it.

[08:50]
It's like something's missing,

[08:52]
but I can't put any of my fingers on it.

[08:53]
Um, maybe once we add the music--

[08:55]
The music? Are you kidding me?

[08:57]
Music? You're fired.

[08:58]
What dumb shit brought this dumb shit?

[08:59]
Okay, you're fired too.

[09:00]
Oh, okay.

[09:02]
Anyone else got any bright ideas?

[09:04]
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

[09:06]
Hey, maybe it make it more Diane-y?

[09:09]
- Um, excuse me? - I don't know.

[09:11]
This is probably stupid, but the whole story's

[09:13]
about how this guy's in love with this lady, right?

[09:15]
But we don't even know who she is or what she wants.

[09:18]
I mean, maybe give her more lines or words

[09:21]
or, I don't know, feelings or whatever?

[09:23]
What?

[09:24]
He's new. He doesn't know the rules.

[09:26]
Forgive him, mighty Caesar.

[09:34]
Yes. Yeah.

[09:35]
I love you.

[09:36]
Who is this kid?

[09:37]
You're a genius.

[09:39]
- I'm gonna kiss your face. - What?

[09:40]
Oh! [laughs]

[09:42]
Come back to my web.

[09:43]
Let's talk about Diane's feelings

[09:45]
and make this baby sing.

[09:46]
Hey, Todd, talk to him about the wardrobe,

[09:49]
specifically the top half of the wardrobe,

[09:51]
specifically the shirt part of the top half of the wardrobe,

[09:54]
specifically the neck part of the shirt part of the wardrobe.

[09:57]
[cell phone rings]

[09:59]
Ugh. What now?

[10:00]
I'm sick of this dog and pony show.

[10:02]
The movie is dumb.

[10:04]
Mr. Peanutbutter is annoying the shit out of me,

[10:05]
and there's too much honeydew in the fruit bowl.

[10:07]
Blech. Honeydew is garbage fruit.

[10:09]
Also, why is BoJack being played by an old, nebbishy

[10:11]
five-foot-tall bald guy?

[10:12]
Is that how the world sees me?

[10:13]
Oh, I see.

[10:14]
So I can play Vanya on 42nd Street,

[10:17]
but I'm not a deft-enough talent to capture the essence

[10:20]
of the elusive BoJack Horseman.

[10:22]
So sorry to offend you, sir.

[10:26]
I'm just glad my book's coming out soon

[10:28]
so people will get an opportunity to see

[10:30]
the real BoJack Horseman.

[10:32]
Oh, are you coming out with a book?

[10:33]
You never mentioned it.

[10:34]
Plus, Todd's being super weird.

[10:36]
I think he's onto me.

[10:37]
Onto you in regards to what?

[10:38]
Oh, right, I didn't tell you.

[10:40]
I sabotaged his rock opera by getting him readdicted

[10:42]
to a video game because I didn't want him to move out.

[10:44]
Jesus Christ, BoJack.

[10:46]
Anyway, I think he knows and might be plotting

[10:48]
to sabotage me back.

[10:50]
Why is it that 90% of our conversations

[10:52]
these days revolve around plotting sabotages?

[10:54]
Are you saying I should plot a countersabotage?

[10:56]
No, no more plotting.

[10:57]
Just be a good soldier and do your job.

[11:00]
Nobody is out to get you.

[11:01]
[cell phone beeps]

[11:02]
Have you seen the new draft?

[11:04]
They took it all off you and put it on me.

[11:06]
What?

[11:07]
Apparently some dickweed named Todd

[11:10]
decided I should be three-dimensional

[11:12]
and you should have no lines.

[11:14]
Ugh. Isn't this town sick of creating

[11:16]
three-dimensional roles for women?

[11:18]
This happens to me all the time!

[11:20]
A.O. Scott is sick of talking about how brilliant I am.

[11:23]
Todd.

[11:26]
I guess what I've been saying

[11:27]
for the last seven uninterrupted minutes is,

[11:30]
how can I forgive my father if I can't forgive myself?

[11:34]
True dat.

[11:36]
But none of that matters, because we bring out

[11:39]
the best in each other.

[11:41]
I'm the chocolate, and you're Mr. Peanutbutter!

[11:46]
- True dat. - Mwah!

[11:48]
Cut! Amazing.

[11:50]
This is the movie that I wanted to make.

[11:52]
This is gonna be great.

[11:53]
- Oh, my God, I'm so-- - Ugh, what kind of idiot

[11:55]
puts food on top of a hill?

[11:57]
Hey, so I guess now that the movie's all about Diane,

[12:00]
I really need to dig deep and get to know the real you.

[12:03]
So let's talk and talk and talk until I am you

[12:07]
and you are nothing but a hollowed-out husk

[12:09]
of your former self and every thought and every feeling

[12:11]
you ever had belongs to me and me alone.

[12:15]
So do we like Sprite, or are we more of a 7-Up girl?

[12:19]
Uh, that all sounds great.

[12:22]
But, you know, the person you should really be talking to

[12:24]
is that guy.

[12:26]
- Yeah, okay, I'm done. - Diane loves talking to him.

[12:28]
They have great rapport.

[12:30]
In fact, Diane could spend all day talking to him

[12:34]
and never talk to me again.

[12:36]
Oh, I get it, because Diane doesn't talk to Diane.

[12:41]
- Diane talks to-- - Anybody else.

[12:44]
Hey, Todd, remember that time

[12:45]
when you wouldn't clean up your shit?

[12:47]
That was hilarious.

[12:48]
- We've had some good times. - Oh. Hi.

[12:50]
So I was thinking, I have some...

[12:52]
[sighs] pretty sloppy seconds left over from P.F. Chang's

[12:55]
in the fridge, and I don't think that I want it anymore.

[12:58]
Maybe tonight you could eat it.

[12:59]
Friendly gesture because we're friends.

[13:01]
- Uh... - Oh-oh, there's my guy.

[13:03]
I heard you had a few more thoughts about the script.

[13:05]
I do.

[13:06]
I was just thinking, what if we made the BoJack character

[13:09]
into a real shithead?

[13:11]
- Is that really necessary? - I don't think it's necessary.

[13:13]
Yeah, let's-- Let's make him be a real selfish asshole

[13:17]
so the audience has someone to root against.

[13:19]
You're probably right.

[13:20]
Let's take another swing at the script

[13:22]
and give BoJack more to do.

[13:23]
Now, when you say, "Give BoJack more to do"--

[13:25]
Not now, Mr. Peanutbutter.

[13:26]
And also, now that I'm thinking about it,

[13:28]
why does the movie have to take place on Earth?

[13:32]
You are blowing my head.

[13:35]
- I hope you like Oscars. - Honeydew?

[13:37]
More like, "Honey, do I enjoy eating it?

[13:39]
Yes, I do." Right?

[13:41]
Not right, and I would love to go through all the reasons why,

[13:43]
but I've got bigger concerns right now.

[13:44]
- Honeydew, go on. - Did you notice

[13:46]
that the Mr. Peanutbutter part has been cut in half?

[13:48]
- What is happening to our movie? - I thought you hated the movie.

[13:51]
Yeah, I do, but if I'm gonna be in a dumb movie

[13:53]
I hate that makes no sense,

[13:54]
I should at least be the star of it.

[13:56]
Look, I agree that this movie has really lost its way.

[14:00]
I mean, first of all, why would Mr. Peanutbutter

[14:02]
wear a crew neck T-shirt?

[14:04]
And second of all, uh...

[14:06]
It's just the shirt, isn't it?

[14:08]
It doesn't make sense.

[14:09]
I'm a V-neck man.

[14:10]
A V you can put your sunglasses in.

[14:12]
Can you do that with a crew neck?

[14:14]
Because I'd like to see you tr--

[14:16]
Whoa.

[14:18]
[groaning]

[14:21]
Bagel.

[14:22]
Thanks so much for running this scene with me.

[14:24]
I have so many lines to learn.

[14:26]
Yeah, well, most of my lines are, "True dat,"

[14:29]
but I guess it never hurts to practice.

[14:31]
The citizens of Planet D want their king back.

[14:34]
But I'm more concerned with getting my self-esteem back

[14:37]
after being in the shadow of powerful men for so long.

[14:40]
True dat.

[14:41]
Is it just me, or is this movie

[14:43]
kind of flying off the rails?

[14:44]
Well, I don't want to overuse my catchphrase here,

[14:46]
but true dat.

[14:48]
This is so typical.

[14:49]
I just wanted to do something light and fun

[14:52]
to distract me from the deep well of sadness that is my life.

[14:57]
You probably wouldn't understand.

[14:58]
Oh, puh-lease.

[15:00]
I'm so deep down a well of sadness

[15:02]
that Baby Jessica is like, "Damn."

[15:05]
Shut up and kiss me, you miserable goof.

[15:08]
What?

[15:09]
Oh. Okay. Mwah.

[15:12]
Pop this in a drawer.

[15:14]
Huh?

[15:17]
- [glass shatters] - This is good, baby.

[15:19]
Oh, this is amazing.

[15:21]
Naomi, I haven't felt like this since--

[15:23]
No, no, shh, shh, shh!

[15:24]
Call me Diane.

[15:28]
Okay, got my bagel.

[15:30]
Now back to work.

[15:32]
Hey, guys.

[15:33]
Hey, guys!

[15:37]
Wow, wow.

[15:39]
So you guys really hit it off, huh?

[15:41]
That's awesome.

[15:43]
Want to do some hand stuff in the bathroom

[15:44]
before we go down to set?

[15:46]
You read my mind.

[15:47]
Now, kiss me some sour cream.

[15:50]
Hey, so I finished the book

[15:53]
and sent the draft to the publishers.

[15:54]
What? My book is ready?

[15:55]
Let me read it. Can I read it?

[15:56]
Call Pinky.

[15:58]
He'll probably send you a copy as soon as he's done with it.

[16:00]
All right! You hang tight, baby.

[16:02]
I got an instant classic to read.

[16:04]
Keep the engine running, though,

[16:05]
because if I know me, this book is gonna give me

[16:06]
a pretty big erection.

[16:08]
Okay, enjoy! Keep an open mind.

[16:09]
You'll love it. It's a work in progress.

[16:13]
[telephone rings]

[16:14]
Hello. Penguin Publishing.

[16:15]
Unless this is that loan shark,

[16:17]
in which case, Johnny's House of Noodles.

[16:19]
May I interest you in our bento lunch box?

[16:20]
Pinky, it's me.

[16:22]
Let me read the book. Give me, give me, give me.

[16:23]
Okay, okay, now, I should warn you,

[16:25]
it's not quite what we expected, but it is good.

[16:29]
I'm telling you, this could really sell.

[16:30]
I might actually get to see my kids again.

[16:32]
Great. Send it over.

[16:33]
I'll read it right now.

[16:35]
All right, I sent it, but just remember--

[16:36]
To set my expectations sky-high?

[16:39]
- Way ahead of you. - [cell phone beeps]

[16:40]
All right, book, let's see what you got.

[16:43]
BoJack, this is you.

[16:46]
One Trick Pony?

[16:47]
"The first time I met BoJack Horseman,

[16:49]
he was puking cotton candy off the deck

[16:51]
of his lavish house in the Hills,

[16:53]
the lights of the city twinkling below us.

[16:55]
The Make-A-Wish kids will not soon forget

[16:57]
the time the great BoJack Horseman

[16:59]
referred to their parents as 'a bunch of used jizz bags.'

[17:02]
He filled the air with words, terrified of silence,

[17:05]
as one often is who is smart enough to recognize

[17:07]
his many personal failings but unwilling or unable

[17:11]
to take the steps required to fix them.

[17:13]
Got out of the car, stepped out toward the coast,

[17:15]
and looked across the water,

[17:17]
and for a moment, he said nothing."

[17:21]
What the shit was that?

[17:24]
What the shit is this?

[17:26]
It's a phone. Well, a tiny computer, really.

[17:28]
I mean, amazing what technology can--

[17:29]
You were supposed to ghostwrite my memoir,

[17:31]
but instead you wrote a story about how you spent

[17:33]
six months with me and saw what a big, dumb loser I am.

[17:35]
Well, I realized that the best way

[17:37]
to fully capture you, warts and all--

[17:40]
This isn't warts and all. It's just warts.

[17:42]
Where's the all?

[17:43]
I come off like a total asshole.

[17:44]
You come off as complex and deeply troubled

[17:47]
but ultimately sympathetic.

[17:49]
You might be too close to see that.

[17:50]
There's an entire chapter about me eating apple fritters.

[17:53]
You did go through that fritter phase.

[17:55]
Is this book how you see me?

[17:56]
That day we ran errands together,

[17:57]
I thought that we had a really good time,

[17:59]
but you just wrote about how I cried

[18:00]
because the dry cleaner took my head shot down.

[18:02]
You were very emotional.

[18:04]
They didn't even replace me with anyone.

[18:06]
Now it's just a faded spot where my face used to be.

[18:08]
This will actually do wonders for your career.

[18:10]
Trust me.

[18:11]
I mean, you're just a dumb actor

[18:13]
who doesn't know anything about books, right?

[18:15]
- [laughs] - What?

[18:17]
Remember? From before?

[18:18]
Oh, I don't think you understand

[18:19]
what's happening here.

[18:20]
This is not a casual conversation between friends.

[18:23]
This is your boss telling his employee

[18:25]
that she did a bad job.

[18:27]
- Try again. - What?

[18:29]
Start over, but do it right this time.

[18:31]
Nobody is ever gonna see this.

[18:35]
- Ugh! - [cell phone dialing]

[18:37]
- [cell phone vibrating] - Diane?

[18:40]
Hey, Wayne, you still work for BuzzFeed?

[18:42]
Um, yes.

[18:43]
'Cause I got something that's gonna get you

[18:44]
a shit-ton of hearts or digs or smileys

[18:48]
or whatever the hell you measure your journalism with.

[18:51]
Curses!

[18:53]
My evil plan has been defeated, but I'll be back.

[18:56]
You haven't heard the last

[18:57]
of Evil Emperor BoJackitron Horsemaniac.

[19:01]
Oh, no!

[19:02]
You shot a laser at me!

[19:03]
Oh, no! I'm dying.

[19:05]
Oh, no, I'm dead.

[19:08]
And so now that we've escaped

[19:10]
the evil clutches of the emperor,

[19:12]
I'm free to assume my natural form,

[19:15]
an all-knowing floating orb of light?

[19:17]
True dat.

[19:19]
- Cut, cut. - [buzzer sounds]

[19:20]
Come on, guys, this is ridiculous.

[19:22]
Is this even a movie anymore?

[19:23]
Oh, maybe it isn't a movie.

[19:27]
Yeah, maybe it's an immersive smartphone app

[19:29]
or a 21st-century approach to 360-degree media envelopment.

[19:34]
Yeah, or maybe it's just, like, a feeling, you know?

[19:38]
- We've got work to do. - Yeah, yeah.

[19:40]
- Oh, my God, this is so good. - Oh, this is gonna be awesome.

[19:42]
Yes! Go, Todd.

[19:43]
Hello?

[19:45]
Are you just gonna leave me like this?

[19:46]
Anyone?

[19:47]
Ah!

[19:49]
Oh, good. You're here.

[19:51]
Oh, hi, BoJack.

[19:52]
This whole day's been a shit show.

[19:54]
The book turned out to be a total hatchet job.

[19:56]
The movie's a disaster.

[19:57]
But thank God I have one good thing in my life,

[20:00]
and that's you.

[20:01]
BoJack, I--

[20:02]
Please let me say this before I lose my nerve.

[20:04]
I spent 50 years roaming the countryside

[20:06]
as a wild stallion, but I am tired of the rodeo,

[20:09]
and I'm finally ready to saddle up.

[20:11]
BoJack--

[20:12]
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

[20:13]
this mustang wants to rest his head in the comforts

[20:16]
of your spacious barn.

[20:17]
Uh, what?

[20:18]
I'm in love with you, Naomi.

[20:20]
BoJack, they fired me

[20:21]
and replaced me with a ball on a stick.

[20:24]
I'm so sorry.

[20:25]
But look at the bright side.

[20:27]
Now you and I can just hang out and talk about feelings.

[20:29]
No, but you're not getting it. Boys never get it.

[20:32]
BoJack, I was in character as Diane,

[20:34]
and as Diane, we had a real connection.

[20:38]
But now that I'm off the movie, I'm Naomi again,

[20:40]
and Naomi is not interested in BoJack Horseman.

[20:44]
In fact, she thinks he's kind of gross.

[20:47]
So I didn't fall in love with Naomi Watts?

[20:49]
No.

[20:50]
You fell in love with Diane.

[20:52]
Naomi what?

[20:54]
Good-bye, BoJack.

[20:56]
Ugh.

[20:57]
See? Nothing.

[21:03]
What's going on? Why are they packing up?

[21:04]
Oh, glad you're here. This is exciting.

[21:07]
Since we last talked, this film has gone through

[21:08]
- so many permutations. - So many.

[21:10]
First, we reimagined the whole film

[21:12]
as an interactive social-media experience.

[21:15]
Those are the dumbest words I've ever heard.

[21:16]
I know.

[21:17]
So we realized it was actually

[21:19]
more of a floating art installation,

[21:21]
but that didn't feel right either.

[21:23]
We thought, is it a high-end perfume?

[21:24]
A series of interrelated fortune cookies?

[21:26]
A hat that if you turn it upside down, it's a boat?

[21:29]
- No, it's none of those things. - Exactly.

[21:32]
That's why we finally settled on this.

[21:34]
Voilà!

[21:35]
What am I looking at?

[21:37]
[Todd] It is a bimonthly curated box of snacks.

[21:40]
I don't know what that means.

[21:41]
I know. It's confusing.

[21:43]
Not the bimonthly that means twice a month,

[21:44]
the bimonthly that means every other month,

[21:47]
and each time it's a different box of snacks.

[21:50]
This is the future of cinema.

[21:52]
You guys, finally, my story has been told.

[21:56]
Okay, that's a wrap, everyone. [claps hands]

[21:59]
Thanks for making this box of snacks a reality.

[22:02]
Let's go home.

[22:05]
What the hell happened to the movie?

[22:08]
Shit, there were snacks here the whole time?

[22:11]
Not bad.

[22:12]
- Whoa! - Look, I get it.

[22:14]
You destroyed my big chance at a comeback

[22:16]
as revenge for what I did to your rock opera.

[22:18]
Revenge? Oh, that would have been such a good idea.

[22:21]
Damn it, Todd!

[22:23]
Look, I figured out what you did,

[22:25]
but I've been trying to put it behind me and do my job.

[22:27]
So cutting my part down was not about revenge?

[22:30]
No.

[22:31]
And making BoJack the villain of your movie

[22:33]
was not a coded statement of your feelings about me?

[22:36]
No.

[22:37]
Oh, okay, great.

[22:39]
Well, I'm-- I'm glad we buried the hatchet

[22:41]
and everything's cool.

[22:42]
Uh, actually, you know, everything is not cool.

[22:46]
You ruined my rock opera by using character actress

[22:48]
Margo Martindale to trick me

[22:50]
into playing an addictive video game.

[22:52]
And saying it all together like that,

[22:54]
it all sounds kind of ludicrous.

[22:55]
But still, it was something I cared about,

[22:58]
and what you did really hurt me.

[23:01]
Oh. Well, this feels shitty.

[23:03]
You sure you don't want to just get some revenge real quick--

[23:06]
thump me once in the stones and then we'll be even?

[23:08]
I got to go.

[23:09]
I've got some artisanal popcorns to gauge the mouthfeel of.

[23:13]
- Hey, BoJack. - Yeah?

[23:15]
You want an apple fritter?

[23:16]
Uh, sure.

[23:18]
- Yeah, I bet you would. - [laughter]

[23:20]
I bet you'd like an apple fritter.

[23:21]
Yeah, an apple fritter would be great.

[23:23]
Why? What-- What-- What's happening here?

[23:26]
"Five Shocking Facts From New BoJack Book"?

[23:28]
No. No!

[23:30]
Um, everyone, please turn off your Internet.

[23:32]
It has gone bad.

[23:34]
I repeat, the Internet has gone foul.

[23:37]
- What a loser. - I'm glad I'm not that guy.

[23:39]
Give me your phones. I'm a celebrity.

[23:40]
You have to listen to me.

[23:42]
Look at his deep well of sadness.

[23:43]
It's hilarious.

[23:45]
Don't look at me. I'm well-adjusted.

[23:48]
- You all want my life. - [laughter]

[23:50]
Uh, what the hell?

[23:51]
I know, I know. But if you just listen for--

[23:53]
You posted your dumb little book on the Internet.

[23:55]
No, I just leaked the first couple chapters,

[23:57]
and people are already talking about it.

[23:58]
This is wildly unprofessional. Who do you think you are?

[24:02]
I know you're mad, and you have every right to be,

[24:04]
but you got to read some of these comments.

[24:05]
People love you.

[24:07]
And they're gonna love you even more

[24:08]
when they read the rest of my book.

[24:10]
- Your book? - Our book.

[24:12]
Nobody is gonna read that book.

[24:13]
How do you still not get that?

[24:15]
It is never going to be published.

[24:17]
BoJack, I stand by my work.

[24:19]
This is a really good book.

[24:21]
And if you just give it time, you'll see.

[24:24]
[sighs]

[24:26]
Maybe you're right.

[24:28]
Really?

[24:29]
No. You're fired.
