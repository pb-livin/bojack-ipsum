[00:11]
So, at the end of the day,

[00:12]
I'm just a regular guy trying to live a regular life.

[00:15]
Remember that time you peed in Drew Barrymore's car?

[00:18]
Uh, yes, I remember that. Why do you remember that?

[00:21]
It was in your book.

[00:23]
-You should do that to someone here. -What? No.

[00:26]
Well, anyway, I can't believe I'm on a date with BoJack Horseman.

[00:29]
I feel like that anonymous girl from Chapter 8 of your book

[00:33]
mixed with the pluck and determination of that anonymous girl

[00:36]
-from Chapter 12. -We don't need to dwell on the past.

[00:39]
Wait, shut up. Is this the restaurant you bought

[00:41]
when you were trying to show up Mr. Peanutbutter?

[00:44]
-Uh... No. -Hey, this table's a little wobbly.

[00:47]
Want to yell at the waiter and make a scene?

[00:49]
-No, I don't need-- -Come on, do that BoJack thing

[00:52]
where you make a big deal and everyone laughs,

[00:54]
but at the same time we relate,

[00:55]
because you're saying the things polite society won't.

[00:58]
That's not-- Ugh...

[00:59]
-Is everything all right over here? -No, everything is not all right.

[01:03]
This table's been wobbling all evening.

[01:05]
If I wanted to flop around and get seasick for an hour, I'd call your mother.

[01:09]
-Something in that area or...? -Take me home now

[01:11]
and don't let me get out of bed until I turn horse-colored.

[01:16]
-What are you doing? -Did you want me to stay?

[01:19]
No, I wanted you to leave more quietly.

[01:21]
Some of us here are trying to forget you exist.

[01:23]
"Forget you exist." Classic BoJack. Love it.

[01:25]
[BoJack sighs]

[01:27]
[Claire] Oh, my God, are you Todd? [Todd] Uh, yes.

[01:30]
[Claire] "Shut up, Todd!"

[01:32]
[Claire laughs]

[01:33]
[Todd] Aw, okay.

[01:36]
[♪♪]

[02:33]
Hey, Todd, can you drive me to get my car?

[02:35]
I wanted to be responsible last night, so I Ubered home

[02:38]
-and left my car in the fountain. -Sorry, BoJack.

[02:41]
I gotta get ready for my grand opening. It's finally happening. My Disneyland.

[02:46]
I realize that by saying "what" I might set off a chain of events

[02:49]
whereby we continue this conversation, but what?

[02:52]
Well, remember when I first moved in and I kept asking

[02:55]
-if we could go to Disneyland? -I do not.

[02:57]
And then you said that there was no Disneyland.

[02:59]
-No. -That Disneyland was a made-up lie,

[03:02]
like the tooth fairy, that parents use to get their kids to behave.

[03:06]
-Oh, yeah, that shut you up. -Sure did.

[03:08]
But then I thought, why isn't there a Disneyland?

[03:12]
People would love it!

[03:13]
So, I took matters into my own hands,

[03:16]
and over the last five years, I built my own Disneyland.

[03:19]
You've been doing this for five years? How have you never mentioned it?

[03:23]
I bought that cheap plot of non-arable dirt by the toxic waste dump

[03:27]
-up the hill from the old fire station. -Okay, Todd.

[03:30]
-I'm gonna build a Disneyland. -Sounds great, champ.

[03:33]
If it wasn't for that, she never would've gotten sober.

[03:36]
Just finished drawing up blueprints for that Disneyland I'm building.

[03:39]
Kind of busy here, Todd.

[03:41]
So, it turned out to be a good thing I peed in her car.

[03:43]
Sorry for all the noise.

[03:45]
Got this crew of worker bees to help me build my Disneyland.

[03:49]
Okay, I get it. You are building your own Disneyland.

[03:53]
-Literally the first I'm hearing of this. -Anyway, tomorrow we open the gates.

[03:57]
Finally, people will have a place to go after they win the Super Bowl.

[04:02]
But you do know that there already is a Disneyland?

[04:04]
-Yeah, I built it. -No, I mean the real Disneyland.

[04:07]
You mean, the one in the hearts and minds of children everywhere?

[04:10]
-The one in Anaheim! -I think we're saying the same thing.

[04:13]
Are we?

[04:17]
Well, I think it's safe to take the cone off.

[04:20]
I can do it for a small co-pay.

[04:23]
Can't say I'll miss it,

[04:24]
but we did have some crazy adventures together these last few weeks.

[04:30]
Honey, would you rub my chin for me so I can remember things?

[04:34]
Oh, um, okay. Uh...

[04:36]
Yeah, memories.

[04:38]
Hey, where should we go for my first meal after the operation?

[04:42]
It's not an operation, but we could go to Storky's again.

[04:44]
Oh, yeah! We're finally due for our free sub.

[04:48]
"Storky's, where your 81st sandwich is free."

[04:51]
We've been there 80 times? It just opened last month.

[04:55]
Yeah, but you love it, so whenever you suggest it, I always say yes.

[04:58]
Yeah, but 80 times?

[05:02]
Well, that'll be $6000.

[05:05]
Good thing you're getting a free sandwich, huh?

[05:11]
What the...?

[05:14]
Huh?

[05:16]
Okay, you guys. [yells] You vultures are killing me!

[05:20]
I'm sure he's talking about other vultures.

[05:25]
Ah, the Valley.

[05:27]
Because sometimes you wanna go where no one knows your name.

[05:30]
-[Pinky] BoJack Horseman! -Pinky? Hey, how are you?

[05:34]
[stammers]

[05:36]
Oh, great!

[05:37]
-How's the book biz? -Who knows?

[05:39]
I jumped off that burning ship. Print media? What a joke.

[05:43]
Now I got a job in broadcast network television,

[05:46]
a booming industry with nowhere to go but up.

[05:50]
Oh, God.

[05:52]
-What are you doing here? -Oh, my boss loves this place.

[05:55]
Do you know Wanda Pierce?

[05:57]
Wanda just got named head of programming at MBN.

[06:00]
We're here to celebrate.

[06:01]
Well, that and she just woke up from a 30-year coma.

[06:04]
Wait, she just got out of a 30-year coma

[06:07]
and she's the head of programming at a major broadcast network?

[06:10]
She's been with the company 30 years. Everyone above her kept getting fired.

[06:14]
Besides, she's got some really fresh ideas.

[06:17]
I am really feeling The Kirk Cameron Show.

[06:20]
I don't even need a pilot. Let's just order 22 episodes.

[06:24]
How about a new show where celebrities try to guess

[06:27]
whether or not people have talent?

[06:29]
We'll air it three nights a week.

[06:31]
[all gasp]

[06:32]
Okay, what if we got relevant superstar David Copperfield

[06:36]
to make the World Trade Center disappear?

[06:40]
I hate to be the one to tell you this,

[06:43]
but David Copperfield really isn't a big draw anymore.

[06:46]
Actually, everything feels fresh

[06:49]
if you just forget the last 30 years ever happened.

[06:51]
Huh.

[06:52]
[woman over PA] And here's a special request.

[06:54]
I've never even heard of this song,

[06:56]
but let's give it a spin: "Special Feeling."

[06:59]
Wanda, meet the one and only BoJack Horseman.

[07:02]
-Who? -BoJack.

[07:04]
-Who? -BoJack Horseman.

[07:05]
Is that name supposed to mean something to me?

[07:08]
[light rock ballad playing over speakers]

[07:14]
-Do you want to go skate? -Nah. You know what they say,

[07:16]
you can lead a horse to roller, but you can't make him rink.

[07:19]
[laughing]

[07:21]
-What? -That's really funny.

[07:23]
-You're funny. -Really?

[07:25]
Oh, my God. You should be on TV,

[07:27]
[gasps] which, holy shit, they're flat now.

[07:29]
Actually, I was on. You know what, I'm sick of talking about me.

[07:33]
Let's talk about you.

[07:41]
[Wanda] Next thing I know, I'm waking up from a 30-year coma.

[07:44]
So, now I'm sleeping on my sister's couch, but it's not ideal.

[07:47]
She's molting. You know how sisters are.

[07:50]
Oh, jeez, got a couple curly guys in here with the regulars.

[07:53]
How hard is it to look before they bring it out?

[07:56]
-Excuse me, miss? -I know, isn't it cool?

[07:58]
-Like we're getting away with something. -What?

[08:01]
Don't you love it when appetizers have a little crossover episode?

[08:04]
It's like when you're watching Happy Days and Mork shows up.

[08:07]
Oh, yeah, I guess.

[08:09]
Or like when Kramer was on Murphy Brown.

[08:11]
-Who? -Hey, you want to get out of here?

[08:17]
I don't want MBN to just be another boring old network, you know what I mean?

[08:22]
-Yes, totally. -I want to take risks.

[08:24]
I want to swing for the fences, you know? Otherwise, what are we doing?

[08:28]
Oh, my God, is it morning? We stayed up all night talking,

[08:31]
-and we didn't even have sex. -Well, it's not too late.

[08:34]
Oh!

[08:40]
-That was fantastic. -Oh, yes.

[08:43]
Of course, I haven't had sex in 30 years. I hope.

[08:46]
-Something's wrong. -What is it?

[08:47]
I don't know, I feel weird, like I want to spend more time with you

[08:51]
-even though I know we just had sex. -Oh, okay.

[08:54]
No, you don't understand.

[08:55]
We already had sex, but I still want to spend time with you.

[08:59]
Is that normal? Am I normal? What is happening to me?

[09:03]
We can spend more time together.

[09:05]
I want to do things with you. Fully clothed, sober, in daylight hours.

[09:10]
-Okay. -I don't understand these feelings.

[09:12]
Let's get food? Or walk in park? Or--

[09:16]
Oh, God, it's coming. I can't stop it.

[09:19]
-Do you want to go to Disneyland? -Okay.

[09:26]
[carnival music playing over speakers]

[09:31]
[child crying]

[09:33]
Disneyland has a lot more sparking wires and loose nails than I remember.

[09:37]
Please hold your questions until the end of the tour.

[09:40]
Here we have Mr. Todd's Wild Death-Coaster.

[09:45]
The name is a work in progress,

[09:46]
but we wanted to work "death" into the title for liability reasons.

[09:50]
And this is Gabe Jr., the Grease Fire of the Caribbean.

[09:55]
-This is boring. I want to go home. -Vincent, be nice!

[10:00]
He's a little cranky because he just got adult braces.

[10:03]
-You mean, braces. -Princess Carolyn, stop embarrassing me!

[10:07]
Ugh.

[10:08]
And here we have Cinderella's magical pile of used mattresses.

[10:14]
[child] Help!

[10:15]
Is it a good idea to keep all those mattresses

[10:17]
-so close to an active grease fire? -Where's your sense of wonder, Diane?

[10:21]
-Your friend is really negative. -Yeah, don't be so negative, Diane.

[10:25]
-What? -You know I hate negativity.

[10:27]
I mean, I don't hate it because that's also negative, but you know.

[10:32]
[quacks, then yells]

[10:33]
[children laughing]

[10:34]
-Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter. -Hey, buddy. This place is amazing.

[10:39]
It's like some sort of Disney version of Knott's Berry Farm.

[10:42]
Oh, that's exactly what I was going for!

[10:45]
I can't wait to get involved

[10:46]
and really spray the old Mr. Peanutbutter scent on everything.

[10:49]
Uh, I was sort of thinking of this as kind of just my thing.

[10:55]
Well, technically, you did build this while working for P.B. Livin,

[10:59]
so I have the blah-blah-blah of first refusal or whatever.

[11:03]
Oh, uh, okay.

[11:04]
I mean, that's just good business.

[11:06]
We're in this together now, Todd, and nothing will distract me from--

[11:10]
Erica! You can't be here. This place is filled with children.

[11:16]
Coach said he saw you headed to the visitor's locker room

[11:19]
with a steel pipe.

[11:20]
You really think I'm the guy who busted that pinto's leg?

[11:23]
'Cause if I am, you should be a lot more goddamn scared of me.

[11:27]
Hey! My girlfriend's here. Look, everyone! I have a girlfriend!

[11:31]
Sure. We'll cut there.

[11:33]
The middle of your line is as good a place as any.

[11:35]
-What are you doing here? -Just wanted to stop by.

[11:38]
We're filming Hey, I Think You Can Dance! next door.

[11:41]
Look at you, all professional.

[11:43]
Like Natalie Portman in that movie where she was a professional.

[11:46]
Who? [giggles] People are watching.

[11:48]
Ugh.

[11:49]
The first time BoJack dates a woman his own age,

[11:52]
she's basically just a stunted 20-year-old.

[11:54]
Well, BoJack's stunted, too. He got famous in his twenties,

[11:57]
so he'll be in his twenties forever.

[11:58]
After you get famous, you stop growing, you don't have to.

[12:01]
Every celebrity has an age of stagnation.

[12:04]
I'm glad I never got famous.

[12:05]
I mean, I did write a best-selling book, but I'm not famous-famous.

[12:08]
It doesn't just happen when you get famous.

[12:10]
Your age of stagnation is when you stop growing.

[12:13]
For most, it's when they get married, settle into a routine.

[12:16]
You meet someone who loves you unconditionally

[12:18]
and never challenges you or wants you to change,

[12:21]
and then you never change.

[12:23]
But mostly it's just the famous people, right?

[12:29]
Stella! Stella!

[12:32]
Corona Light.

[12:34]
This place is incredible.

[12:36]
I wanted to make you feel at home,

[12:38]
and nothing was bigger in the '80s than '50s nostalgia.

[12:42]
It really feels like I'm back in the '80s, feeling like I'm back in the '50s.

[12:46]
It's like if Back to the Future and Peggy Sue Got Married got married.

[12:49]
[man over radio] Okay, teenyboppers,

[12:51]
let's take things back to the '50s, '50s style,

[12:54]
with this classic '50s hit that everybody remembers:

[12:58]
"I Just Met My Perfect Match."

[13:01]
[do-wop ballad plays over speakers]

[13:08]
Wanda, these last few days have been so amazing.

[13:12]
You've given me a fresh start.

[13:14]
In fact, it almost feels like I just woke up from a 30-year coma.

[13:17]
I'm sorry, did you say you just woke up from a 30-year coma?

[13:21]
-Oh, no, not me. Her. -That's insane.

[13:23]
I just woke up from a 30-year coma.

[13:25]
[record stops]

[13:26]
Whoa! Sorry about that needle skip, folks.

[13:28]
Let's start that song again from the beginning.

[13:32]
[do-wop ballad plays over speakers]

[13:39]
I'm Alex.

[13:40]
-Wanda. -And I'm BoJack.

[13:42]
It's been really tough for me these last few weeks.

[13:45]
I've never seen Home Alone and everyone makes me feel like a freak because of it.

[13:48]
-You've never seen Home Alone? -I've never seen it!

[13:51]
-Also, I don't really know what a DVR is. -Neither do I!

[13:54]
-No one does. It's just a magic box. -Wanda, we have so much in common.

[13:59]
Really it's just one thing.

[14:00]
You can't count each individual thing as a different thing.

[14:03]
That's like saying I have a lot in common with Kanye West

[14:06]
because we both breathe air.

[14:08]
[both] Who? Jinx. Buy me a Coke Zero.

[14:10]
What's a Coke Zero? I have no idea.

[14:12]
[both laughing]

[14:13]
We gotta hang out more. I didn't know there was anyone else like me.

[14:17]
Give me your fax and pager number so I can add them to my Rolodex.

[14:20]
Tubular.

[14:21]
[BoJack sighs]

[14:23]
I don't trust that guy. I bet he's seen Home Alone.

[14:27]
BoJack, I'm starting to lose the thread of your character.

[14:30]
You think you can drop the jealous boyfriend routine? It feels a little done.

[14:34]
You're right, I'm sorry. Call me Snoop Dogg

[14:36]
-because I will drop it like it's hot. -BoJack, I don't--

[14:39]
I got that one! Snoopy the dog. From "Peanuts." Okay.

[14:49]
I got here as fast as I could.

[14:51]
Where's this next Haley Joel Osment?

[14:54]
-That was a lie to get you here. -Aw, fish.

[14:56]
-There's never a next Haley Joel Osment. -And there never will be.

[14:59]
Sorry I tricked you, but with Todd running his own Disneyland

[15:02]
and actress Margo Martindale in prison

[15:04]
for some reason I don't remember, you're the best friend I've got.

[15:07]
Now grab the binoculars. I need dirt on Wanda's new gentleman friend.

[15:11]
No, BoJack. What's the play here?

[15:13]
You'll find one little imperfection and harp on it

[15:15]
like you do with my boyfriend?

[15:17]
You do understand what my "thing" is with your boyfriend?

[15:20]
You'll just push her into this other guy's arms.

[15:22]
Wanda likes you. Why ruin that?

[15:27]
This is Comrade Alexander calling KGB High Command.

[15:30]
It's been two weeks since I woke up,

[15:32]
and I still have not been contacted by my handlers.

[15:35]
I am awaiting orders to take down the American dogs and pigs

[15:38]
and other various animals and humans. Come in, KGB High Command.

[15:42]
Slap my salami, the guy's a commie.

[15:50]
Hey, what's going on here?

[15:52]
You've been served with a cease-and-desist from my clients,

[15:56]
the Walt Disney Company.

[15:57]
I wanted to make sure what we were doing here was 100 percent legal,

[16:01]
-so I called a lawyer. -Wait, what?

[16:03]
As it turns out, it's not legal at all. Who knew?

[16:06]
-Mr. Peanutbutter. -We'll see you in court.

[16:10]
-The food court? -No. Regular court.

[16:13]
Okay. But also I'm hungry, so I might just stop by the food court first.

[16:20]
Let the record show, this is the single dumbest case I've ever adjudicated.

[16:25]
-Mr. Chavez? -Okay.

[16:28]
I'm just gonna throw this out there.

[16:29]
Is it possible maybe when the other guys tried to copyright the name Disneyland,

[16:34]
they wrote down something else by mistake,

[16:36]
so "Disneyland" is still up for grabs?

[16:39]
Okay, well, let's have a look at the Articles of Incorporation to see

[16:44]
if Walt Disney accidentally trademarked the wrong name. I'm sure these--

[16:49]
[stammers]

[16:50]
-What? -There's a typo. Di-isneyland.

[16:54]
With two "i"s. That son of a gun trademarked the wrong name.

[16:59]
May I, counselor?

[17:01]
D-I-I-S. This is unambiguous.

[17:04]
-I find in favor of the defendant. -Aw, shit.

[17:08]
-You're the defendant. -Aw, sweet!

[17:11]
Your Otter, this is a gross miscarriage of justice.

[17:15]
Hooray! Gross miscarriage!

[17:21]
And that's how I turned my dream into what I call "The Happiest Place On Urf."

[17:27]
Urf is a made-up magical kingdom I added to the Disney canon.

[17:30]
-Americans, they like this theme park? -Oh, they love it.

[17:34]
It represents everything America stands for.

[17:36]
Da.

[17:37]
-I mean, yeah. -We did it, buddy!

[17:40]
Actually, I did it.

[17:42]
I had the idea to build a park, I did all the work and I beat the lawsuit.

[17:49]
-Well, there's no "i" in "team," right? -But there is an "i" in "Disneyland."

[17:54]
And unlike that other Disneyland, this Disneyland only has one "i".

[18:00]
What are you saying?

[18:01]
You're not welcome at my theme park anymore.

[18:04]
There's only room for one goofy dog there and his name is Pluto.

[18:09]
Todd, no.

[18:11]
I've told the bees if they see you to sting you on sight.

[18:14]
You understand. It's nothing personal. It's just good business.

[18:19]
And that's how we do business on Urf.

[18:22]
-I don't like you like this. -I learned it from you.

[18:26]
If I could get everyone's attention.

[18:28]
You're probably wondering why I invited you all here tonight.

[18:31]
You said it was to celebrate Todd's legal victory.

[18:34]
Right, but obviously, I don't care about that,

[18:36]
so you're probably wondering the real reason.

[18:38]
[Princess Carolyn] No, we just took you at face value.

[18:41]
We have a special guest here tonight.

[18:43]
Alex. Or should I say "comrade"?

[18:46]
[BoJack gasps]

[18:48]
-Why would you say "comrade"? -Oh, I forgot to explain that part.

[18:52]
Alex is a KGB agent bent on destroying America.

[18:56]
[all gasp]

[18:57]
-It truly is a small world after all! -Alex, is that true?

[19:00]
Okay, yes. It's true.

[19:03]
I was a deep-cover KGB operative before I went into my coma.

[19:07]
I've been trying to contact my handler in Russia,

[19:09]
but I can't reach him and I don't know if I ever will.

[19:12]
[all] Aww!

[19:13]
No! He's-- It's not adorable!

[19:16]
He's a soviet sleeper-agent who doesn't realize the Cold War is over.

[19:20]
I felt totally alone in this world before I met Wanda.

[19:23]
And then I met all of you, my friends.

[19:25]
But if you're gonna kick me to the curb

[19:27]
just because I think you're all capitalist swine

[19:30]
and want to see your way of life destroyed, well, so be it.

[19:33]
-Or should I say, So-vi-et. -Oh! Cute. Wordplay.

[19:38]
-That's not even good wordplay. -Wait, how did you know all this?

[19:41]
-BoJack, were you spying on him? -He is literally a spy

[19:45]
trying to destroy America, the country we all live in.

[19:48]
How am I the bad guy here?

[19:49]
BoJack, I am really bumping on the whole you-not-liking-Alex of it all.

[19:54]
-You told me you were going to drop it. -Yeah, but--

[19:56]
I don't care about Alex.

[19:58]
I want to know what happened to the amazing guy

[20:00]
I spent the last few days with, because if this is who you are,

[20:04]
I don't think I like it.

[20:05]
Alex, would you take me back to my sister's place?

[20:07]
Sure thing, Wanda. And I can get you there fast

[20:10]
because I'm always Russian.

[20:12]
[all] Aww!

[20:13]
Seriously?

[20:18]
[BoJack sighs] [Princess Carolyn gasps]

[20:20]
I got here as fast as I could. Where's the next Dakota Fa--?

[20:23]
Oh, I get what happened.

[20:25]
Could you get me a beer from the fridge? I didn't want to stand up.

[20:28]
Wait, no. I don't deserve beer.

[20:30]
You called me all the way over here to not get you a beer?

[20:33]
Why do I always do this? I push away everyone I care about.

[20:36]
Oh, do you? I never noticed that.

[20:38]
Look, you obviously really care about this girl

[20:41]
and that scares you, so you sabotage yourself.

[20:44]
That's my problem. I'm too good at sabotage.

[20:47]
-Why am I so good at everything I do? -Hey, I got a crazy idea.

[20:51]
How about you just stop sulking and go win her back, dummy?

[20:54]
You're right. I gotta win her back, put it all on the line. You know what?

[20:58]
I think I will have that beer, can you get it for me?

[21:01]
[sighs]

[21:02]
-Why do I bother? -Hey, grab a beer for yourself, too!

[21:05]
Actually, I want both beers!

[21:13]
-Wanda. -What do you want, BoJack?

[21:16]
There's something I gotta say. When I was--

[21:18]
-Todd! There's something I gotta say! -Hey, I'm kind of already doing--

[21:21]
I never should have tried to make your thing my thing!

[21:24]
I just got excited and wanted to smear Mr. Peanutbutter all over everything.

[21:28]
I should have been supporting you, like this support beam.

[21:34]
-Or a different support beam. -It's my fault.

[21:38]
The point of Disneyland isn't to make money and win lawsuits.

[21:41]
But I forgot that.

[21:43]
So, these two were so consumed by greed that it destroyed them.

[21:47]
You know, I came here today to blow up Disneyland.

[21:49]
-You what? -But now I realize,

[21:51]
I don't need to take down capitalism.

[21:53]
Capitalism sows the seeds for its own destruction.

[21:56]
It's a snake that eats itself. It's only a matter of time.

[21:59]
[whistling]

[22:01]
Hey, buddy, let's just say we-- Oh!

[22:03]
Oh, no, no, no. No!

[22:07]
Gabe Jr.!

[22:08]
Quick, Todd! The mattress pile!

[22:10]
Jump to safety! No!

[22:14]
Bees, help! Your queen commands you!

[22:20]
No! Bees! Come on!

[22:25]
[groaning]

[22:26]
-You gotta-- Over the-- -What is it, boy? What's wrong?

[22:30]
-Hey, there's trouble. -Did some kid fall down a well?

[22:34]
No, no, no! Listen.

[22:35]
He's trying to tell us a kid fell down a well.

[22:37]
-Let's go, go, go! Come on! -Bad, bad, bad. You gotta--

[22:40]
No, no, no, listen!

[22:44]
Wait, Wanda, we need to talk.

[22:46]
-But the fire. -I don't care about that.

[22:48]
Look, the great guy you've been getting to know, that's me.

[22:51]
That other guy, the guy from the party,

[22:53]
that's me too and you need to know that. I'm not perfect.

[22:57]
I'm cynical and I'm possessive and I can sometimes fly off the handle.

[23:01]
I'm not always the best at being not terrible.

[23:05]
I gotta say, I'm not loving this pitch so far.

[23:07]
But I want to be better, I'm trying to be better.

[23:10]
And when I'm around you, for the first time in 30 years,

[23:12]
I feel like I can be.

[23:14]
Wanda, you make me want to be a better man.

[23:16]
Wow. That's a great line.

[23:18]
-Did you just come up with that? -Yes.

[23:21]
Hey, boys and girls, this is your park DJ speaking.

[23:25]
And as the Titanic's band played on as the ship sank,

[23:28]
so too will I spin one last record as my DJ booth is engulfed in flames.

[23:33]
[slow rock ballad playing over speakers]

[23:44]
[both grunting]

[23:56]
Hooray!

[24:04]
Mr. Peanutbutter.

[24:05]
-You saved me! -No.

[24:07]
I saved us.

[24:12]
Woo-hoo!

[24:13]
-I want to give this a real shot. -I don't know, BoJack.

[24:16]
I just got out of my coma, and I don't have time to waste

[24:19]
if you're still figuring your shit out.

[24:21]
Plus, it's hard to think straight with this fire everywhere.

[24:24]
-Move in with me. -What?

[24:26]
I know it feels fast. We barely know each other.

[24:28]
It's crazy, but I like you.

[24:31]
And sometimes you gotta swing for the fences, right?

[24:34]
-Okay. -Yeah?

[24:36]
Yeah. Let's move in together. Let's do it.

[24:39]
It's crazy, but let's do it!
