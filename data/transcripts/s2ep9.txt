[00:05]
[thunder rumbling]

[00:10]
Sir, you can't send me to Vietnam.

[00:12]
[Nixon] I can do whatever I want.

[00:14]
I'm president of the goddamn United States of America.

[00:17]
Isn't that right, Checkers?

[00:19]
That's what it says on your business cards.

[00:23]
There are going to be riots in the streets.

[00:25]
I'm Secretariat.

[00:27]
You think I'm afraid of a few rioting hippies?

[00:29]
Don't make me laugh. Ha-hoo.

[00:32]
Or whatever a laugh sounds like.

[00:34]
Please, I'll do anything.

[00:36]
You gotta send someone else in my place.

[00:38]
Hmm. Perhaps an arrangement can be... arranged.

[00:46]
I'm just an athlete. I'm no hero. My brother Jeffretariat is the hero.

[00:51]
He's fighting the Reds over in 'Nam,

[00:53]
which is necessary to protect our way of life.

[00:56]
And another hero is President Nixon.

[00:59]
He is one groovy dude.

[01:04]
[BoJack] Groovy.

[01:08]
[coughing]

[01:10]
What the hell are you doing?

[01:12]
Sorry, Mommy!

[01:13]
Don't you dare put that out.

[01:14]
That is a perfectly good cigarette, and you are going to finish it.

[01:18]
But I don't wanna.

[01:20]
And I don't want to be the mother of a quitter.

[01:22]
Finish it.

[01:24]
[coughing]

[01:25]
Jesus Christ, you can't even smoke a cigarette right.

[01:28]
Don't you dare cry, don't you ever cry.

[01:31]
You wanted this.

[01:32]
Are you punishing me for smoking or for stealing?

[01:36]
I'm punishing you for being alive.

[01:43]
Ugh.

[01:45]
Uh, BoJack? You really shouldn't throw a lit cigarette off the--

[01:48]
[fire roaring]

[01:49]
Fine. I'll call 911.

[01:52]
[♪♪]

[02:48]
The fire department got everything under control,

[02:50]
but the cable's out for the neighborhood.

[02:52]
I don't understand what started the fire.

[02:54]
Nobody knows where fires come from, it's a mystery.

[02:56]
Anyway, I am fired up about my first day back on set.

[03:00]
We're gonna finish that big Nixon scene.

[03:02]
We were just one shot away before we went on hiatus.

[03:05]
Yeah, I know. You told me at breakfast.

[03:07]
Why did you call me?

[03:08]
Usually I talk to Diane on the way to work,

[03:10]
but she abandoned me to teach piano in Cordovia or something.

[03:13]
Oh. Well, glad you settled for me because Diane wasn't available.

[03:16]
You bet. Oh, man, I'm gonna kill in this Nixon scene.

[03:19]
BoJack gonna be in "da" house.

[03:22]
In da White House.

[03:24]
What happened to da house set? Da White House set?

[03:27]
-Things changed a little. -You cut the Nixon scene?

[03:30]
The Nixon scene is the core of the whole movie.

[03:32]
Where we see Secretariat be morally corrupted

[03:35]
and get to look into the real darkness of his soul.

[03:37]
It's still all that, except now it happens

[03:39]
while you give a Christmas present to your nieces

[03:42]
and they hug you while your butt is stuck in a chimney.

[03:44]
Is one of the nieces Nixon?

[03:46]
Over hiatus, we ran a focus group.

[03:47]
People don't want all that controversial stuff.

[03:50]
But we were supposed to make a gritty movie about the real Secretariat.

[03:53]
-Warts and all. -Kid, "warts and all" don't pay bubkes.

[03:56]
That's why they took the gay stuff out of A Beautiful Mind.

[03:58]
Know that guy who spent 12 years as a slave?

[04:00]
They don't talk about the 60 years he spent as a jerk.

[04:03]
-Kelsey, you're okay with this? -Eh...

[04:05]
That's showbiz.

[04:06]
See, BoJack, that's the shrug of a pro who gets it.

[04:09]
Good shrugging, kid.

[04:12]
Yo! Care-to-the-O-to-the-Lyn-to-the...

[04:15]
That's the end of your name. We need to talk.

[04:17]
We'll meet in the supply closet in one minute. Break!

[04:19]
Oh, okay.

[04:21]
Ooh, ow.

[04:22]
Carolyn, when you're in the throes of a very ugly divorce such as I am,

[04:26]
along with all that pain and degradation comes a certain perfect clarity,

[04:30]
and right now that clarity is telling me that you and I should get out of here.

[04:36]
Well, what do you mean, "get out of here"?

[04:38]
Beautiful, I'm starting my own agency, and I want you to be my partner in crime.

[04:43]
What? But I can't just leave Vigor.

[04:45]
I've been here 20 years.

[04:46]
Who's gonna water the plants?

[04:48]
Um, I'm sorry. You water the plants?

[04:50]
I started doing it as an intern,

[04:51]
but then no one told me to stop, so it's still kind of my job.

[04:54]
Carolyn, you are my gritty, witty city kitty.

[04:57]
I want you with me, fifty-fifty.

[04:59]
Things are so crazy for me right now. I--

[05:01]
Don't give me that, you want crazy. "Crazy" is your favorite Patsy Cline song

[05:05]
and your second favorite Gnarls Barkley song.

[05:07]
I don't want crazy.

[05:08]
I've got five episodes of The Good Wife piled up on my DVR,

[05:12]
and I just want a night off to enjoy them.

[05:14]
Well, if that's how you feel, I guess I could just go to Vanessa Gekko.

[05:18]
-[Carolyn] Gekko?! -But I'd rather look at you all day.

[05:22]
You're an amazing agent. And you're bright, and you're fun.

[05:26]
And I think we could make something really special.

[05:29]
We weren't doing anything! We were just looking for closet supplies.

[05:33]
Are you the person to talk to about unclogging the toilet?

[05:36]
Stuart, I'm your boss.

[05:38]
Okay, but you're the one in the janitor's closet, so...

[05:41]
-What, I'm the idiot? -[sighs]

[05:47]
[Diane] The first thing you notice about Sebastian St. Clair

[05:50]
is that he speaks in paragraphs.

[05:51]
Even I can't believe how much good we've done here,

[05:54]
and I'll believe almost anything.

[05:55]
In the last six weeks, we dug a new well, built a school,

[05:58]
and next month the community center is doing Seussical.

[06:01]
There we go.

[06:02]
[Diane] In his previous life, Sebastian owned

[06:04]
a chain of high-end department stores.

[06:06]
I want to stock up on muffs.

[06:08]
We're going to sell a lot of muffs this winter. Huzzah!

[06:12]
Diane, I lived a life of power and luxury,

[06:15]
and then my picture was in the newspaper.

[06:17]
-A real-life newspaper! -Uh-huh.

[06:18]
But I knew my life was empty.

[06:20]
At night I heard the cries of children sick and dying.

[06:23]
And I would scream into the night.

[06:25]
Shut up! Shut up, children!

[06:28]
But the phantom cries would not abate.

[06:31]
And so I began my travels,

[06:32]
with little more than a compass, a yearning for adventure,

[06:35]
and several crates full of unsold muffs.

[06:37]
I knew there were people out there just waiting for my help.

[06:40]
Diane, this is Kinko.

[06:42]
I am Kinko.

[06:43]
In his language, it means,

[06:45]
orphan whose parents were murdered by rebels and will die young,

[06:47]
probably from malaria.

[06:49]
Hi, Kinko. I'm Diane.

[06:51]
It means, my parents liked the show Cheers.

[06:53]
Cheers! Oh, you're good. You're very good.

[06:58]
[Diane] When Sebastian St. Clair says you're good,

[07:00]
you want to believe that you really are.

[07:02]
That you, like Sebastian, are part of something bigger than just yourself.

[07:05]
And for a moment, you feel like you are.

[07:09]
[Sebastian] Oh, Kinko made a mess.

[07:12]
Now I finally realize that a triple hug is way more valuable than a Triple Crown.

[07:17]
And cut. Neat.

[07:19]
-Let's break for lunch. -[kids] Oh!

[07:23]
Kelsey, this is a nightmare.

[07:25]
I had to touch three children today, and one of them was sticky.

[07:28]
Yeah, it was you. Wash your damn hands, you gremlin.

[07:30]
-BoJack, there's nothing we can do. -No, this isn't you.

[07:33]
I've seen everything you've done.

[07:35]
Your films are challenging and gritty, and they're great.

[07:37]
I'm not just saying that because they're full of lesbians.

[07:40]
Look, even if I wanted to finish that Nixon scene,

[07:42]
we don't have an Oval Office set.

[07:44]
There's one at the Nixon Library in Yorba Linda.

[07:46]
Why on earth do you know that?

[07:48]
In season three of Horsin' Around, the horse got elected president

[07:51]
and we shot on location.

[07:52]
We can sneak into the library and get the shot, guerilla-style.

[07:55]
Once Turteltaub sees it, he'll love it,

[07:57]
and we can make the movie we both want to make.

[07:59]
[sighs]

[08:00]
-Okay, I'm in. Let's do it. -All right!

[08:03]
Did they really make your character president?

[08:06]
Only for season three.

[08:07]
In season four, it turned out it was all a dream.

[08:09]
They called my airplane Air Horse One.

[08:12]
And the vice president was a hip-hop zebra named Zebro.

[08:14]
-Come on. -It wasn't our best season.

[08:16]
But on the bright side, was not our worst.

[08:19]
Step one, we go to the Nixon Library...

[08:22]
and steal the scale model.

[08:25]
[man as Nixon] Welcome to my library.

[08:27]
I'm Nixon. [chuckles].

[08:30]
[in normal voice] Yeah, you know, some people say I look like Nixon.

[08:33]
Not because he's my dad or anything. That's crazy. Nixon's not my dad.

[08:36]
But if you have any questions about Nixon, I'd be happy to answer them.

[08:40]
Yeah, I have a question. Um...

[08:43]
Is that the lighted exit sign from Nixon's boyhood home?

[08:46]
Uh, no, that's just an exit sign.

[08:49]
-Is that... -Here we go.

[08:50]
...the handicapped drinking fountain he used in the White House?

[08:54]
No, just a normal drinking fountain.

[08:55]
-Hang on. -One more.

[08:57]
-Is that the smoke alarm--? -No.

[08:59]
[chuckles nervously]

[09:02]
So the Oval Office is right here, next to the men's room.

[09:05]
I remember because season three of Horsin' Around was a big cocaine year.

[09:08]
All the pressures of being president.

[09:10]
-I don't see how we'll pull this off. -We're gonna need a crack team.

[09:13]
First, we gotta get the best lock-pick in the city.

[09:16]
-Not interested. -Okay.

[09:19]
The second best lock-pick in the city.

[09:21]
-No way I'm doing that. -Got it.

[09:23]
A lock-pick.

[09:24]
Todd, can you pick locks?

[09:25]
-Kind of. -Great. You're in.

[09:27]
We'll need an expert cat burglar.

[09:29]
All right, Good Wife, let's see what you got.

[09:31]
[BoJack] Hey, Princess Carolyn!

[09:33]
Kelsey and I are gonna break into the Nixon library

[09:36]
to steal a shot for our Secretariat movie.

[09:38]
It's a super-sneaky, kooky caper that stands to benefit you in no way.

[09:43]
Are you in?

[09:44]
[man] Hey! Shut up down there!

[09:46]
-[BoJack] You shut up! -[man] Make me!

[09:48]
[BoJack] Hey, you got a problem? Take it up with my agent,

[09:50]
your downstairs neighbor Princess Carolyn.

[09:52]
[groans]

[09:54]
[BoJack] We'll need someone to play Checkers.

[09:56]
Hey, Chicago! Al Capone, deep dish.

[09:59]
What does Ethan Hawke know? We'll find out tonight. Da Bears.

[10:02]
BoJack, I'd love to help you out,

[10:04]
but I'm super-busy recording promos

[10:06]
for television's highest-rated new game show.

[10:08]
-We can probably do it without you. -This next one's for Seattle.

[10:11]
Hey, Seattle! Space Needle, Starbucks.

[10:14]
What does Ethan Hawke know? We'll find out tonight. Rain.

[10:18]
It's too bad though because I could really bring a lot to this project.

[10:21]
The more I think about it, Checkers wouldn't even be in the shot.

[10:25]
It's just a single on Secretariat.

[10:26]
Hey, Waco, Texas! Terrible tragedy. What does Ethan Hawke know?

[10:30]
-We'll find out tonight. So sorry. -You know what? Forget I even asked.

[10:34]
-Twist my arm, why don't you? I'll do it. -Okay.

[10:37]
Finally, we'll need a criminal mastermind.

[10:39]
Character actress Margo Martindale, you've been a model prisoner.

[10:42]
I'm glad I served my time.

[10:44]
But now I'm ready to move on with my life

[10:46]
and get back to doing small roles

[10:48]
in critically-acclaimed films and television shows.

[10:52]
[prison guard] Watch, purse, lipstick,

[10:55]
Emmy Award for Best Guest Actress.

[11:00]
[sighs deeply]

[11:03]
I need your help with a break-in.

[11:05]
BoJack, I've been out of prison for two minutes.

[11:08]
What took you so long?

[11:10]
[tires squealing]

[11:13]
Kelsey, Mr. Peanutbutter and I are gonna break into the library.

[11:16]
But the problem is, the place is crawling with cops.

[11:19]
They're on high alert

[11:21]
because some idiot stole this model last night.

[11:24]
Yeah, nice work, Todd.

[11:26]
[laughs] Who am I kidding? I can't stay mad at you. You're adorable.

[11:30]
Look at your big saucer eyes. I can go swimming in them!

[11:34]
-Totally. -Now, we need to lose the cops.

[11:37]
The rest of you will create a diversion

[11:39]
by breaking into the only other place in Yorba Linda of cultural significance:

[11:43]
the Discount Fine Art Gallery in the strip mall,

[11:45]
between the tanning salon and the adult bookstore.

[11:48]
Once you set off the alarm, all the cops will go there.

[11:50]
[mimicking siren wails and engine revving]

[11:53]
Now, things could get ugly. One of you is very likely to die.

[11:57]
-Possibly Alan. -Why possibly Alan?

[12:00]
Well, you are the guy none of us knows that well.

[12:02]
I just came to fix your cable.

[12:04]
Alan, you already know too much. You're a part of this now, like it or not.

[12:07]
-But-- -Hey, you think you could keep it down?

[12:10]
I'm reading a script and I'm having trouble focusing,

[12:13]
so now my notes are gonna be confusing and vague.

[12:15]
We're almost done.

[12:16]
I know you're having fun with your police cars,

[12:18]
I just wish you would have asked before you invited these people over.

[12:21]
-I live here, too. -You're right. I'm sorry.

[12:24]
And can you at least let Alan fix the cable before he dies?

[12:27]
I can't die. I'm endangered!

[12:31]
[Diane] "And the truffle-infused gnocchi was the star dish

[12:34]
at this up-and-comer that will please the pickiest of Brooklynites

[12:37]
and the less discerning Staten Islander."

[12:39]
When I grow up, I can be food critic for New Yorker?

[12:41]
You can do anything you want in life.

[12:44]
Not everyone can write for The New Yorker,

[12:45]
but there's always The Atlantic.

[12:47]
[Sebastian] Diane,

[12:49]
I'm concerned you're spending a lot of time with this sickly child.

[12:52]
Remember, you're supposed to be writing about me.

[12:55]
Sure, but isn't this why we're here? To help these people?

[12:58]
I'm here to help these people.

[13:00]
You're here to help me help them by writing a book about me

[13:04]
so people back home will give money to my foundation.

[13:07]
Great.

[13:10]
Okay, come on. Over here. Get it.

[13:15]
[alarm wailing]

[13:17]
We're in. It's too late to turn back now.

[13:19]
One of us isn't going to come out of this alive.

[13:23]
Why do you all keep saying that?

[13:25]
Why can't we all assume we're gonna make it out alive and go from there?

[13:28]
Alan, we've got enough problems without worrying about your imminent death.

[13:32]
Can't we just all shut up and do this?

[13:34]
Why does everything have to be a big, complicated mess?

[13:37]
Like, look at this Thomas Kinkade painting.

[13:39]
It's simple.

[13:41]
And serene. And... pleasant.

[13:44]
[sighs]

[13:47]
I think that the vest makes me look kind of chunky.

[13:50]
I don't do CrossFit five days a week to not look sweet in this uniform.

[13:53]
I swear to God, if you don't shut up about CrossFit--

[13:56]
[woman over radio] Break-in at the Discount

[13:58]
Fine Art Gallery at the strip mall.

[14:00]
Let's roll! That's a thing we say at CrossFit.

[14:04]
[police sirens wailing]

[14:17]
[BoJack shouts]

[14:19]
Remember when my character on Mr. Peanutbutter's House was

[14:22]
-elected president? -Let me guess, it was all a dream?

[14:25]
No, I served half a term, then resigned

[14:27]
because when Zachary had a bad time with peer pressure,

[14:29]
I realized I was spending too much time being president

[14:32]
and not enough time being a dad.

[14:33]
It's like you didn't even watch my show.

[14:36]
Okay, I'd like you here.

[14:38]
And then you are going to be over here.

[14:40]
-Freeze! -I'm union.

[14:42]
-Playing dead. -Breaking and entering?

[14:44]
That is against everything Nixon stood for.

[14:47]
We didn't mean to cause trouble. We're trying to make a movie about Nixon.

[14:50]
Yeah? What, another leftist screed about how corrupt he was?

[14:54]
-Uh... -Or is it about how he had

[14:55]
an illegitimate son,

[14:56]
and the son never knew who his dad was, but always had a hunch it was Nixon,

[15:00]
and then that son grew up to be the security guard at the Nixon Library?

[15:04]
The second one?

[15:05]
Well, if that's true, how come you don't have an actor here to play Nixon?

[15:09]
Because...

[15:10]
we couldn't find anyone who could appropriately capture his magic.

[15:15]
You know, I do a pretty good Nixon.

[15:17]
You? No way.

[15:19]
[as Nixon] Hello, I'm Nixon.

[15:20]
I can't be at your soccer game, but I am your father and I love you very much.

[15:25]
Oh, my God. He's perfect.

[15:26]
We've found our Nixon.

[15:28]
[in normal voice] I can be ready in five.

[15:30]
Uh. Did we get the shot?

[15:33]
It's so peaceful.

[15:36]
-Okay, folks. -[all] Aah!

[15:38]
Party's over. That's something we say at CrossFit.

[15:41]
Ugh. Wait a sec-- I know you!

[15:43]
You were in Justified. You were amazing.

[15:46]
Okay, you caught me.

[15:47]
I am kind of a well-known character actress.

[15:50]
I am such a huge fan, Miss, uh--

[15:53]
What--? What's your name?

[15:55]
Sure, of course.

[15:56]
Everyone loves my work, but apparently not enough

[15:59]
to watch the credits and find out what my name is.

[16:01]
The important thing is that we enjoy your great performances, right?

[16:04]
-How about you enjoy this? Aah! -[both] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

[16:08]
Margo, I thought we agreed, no guns.

[16:10]
Oh, is that what we agreed to? I thought we said "no gum."

[16:13]
But you're also chewing gum.

[16:15]
I'm a wild card.

[16:18]
-Aah! -Return fire!

[16:20]
Watch out!

[16:22]
Oh, no! Alan's dead!

[16:24]
No, I'm fine. The bullet hit my cell phone.

[16:27]
Oh, no! Alan's cell phone is dead!

[16:30]
Nope, phone's fine, too. Oh, hey, I got a text from my wife.

[16:33]
She's going into labor. Guys, I'm gonna be a dad!

[16:36]
See you later!

[16:37]
-[police sirens wailing] -[guns cocking]

[16:42]
Die, you chunky assholes!

[16:45]
See, Jeff? This is what I'm talking about.

[16:47]
[all shouting]

[16:49]
[cop] Shoot!

[16:55]
Oh.

[17:00]
-How could this be any more perfect? -[sing-song] Yoo-hoo.

[17:05]
Vanessa Gekko. How did you get in this painting?

[17:07]
I'm your servant, of course.

[17:09]
In your infinite generosity, you gave me this job

[17:12]
when it became clear that I don't have what it takes

[17:14]
to be a "Hollywoo" power-agent.

[17:16]
Also, my husband left me.

[17:18]
And my children married each other in an unholy incestuous union.

[17:21]
Plus, I have, like, colitis or something.

[17:24]
How appropriate! Fetch me drink, wench.

[17:27]
-Right away, ma'am. -Ah.

[17:30]
Diane...

[17:31]
[Diane] The second thing you notice about Sebastian St. Clair

[17:35]
is how much he talks about himself.

[17:37]
This way is the library I built.

[17:38]
And over there is the statue of me building the library.

[17:41]
And on that wall is a painting of me posing for the statue.

[17:44]
-Put a chapter in your book about that. -Uh-huh.

[17:47]
[Diane] The only respite from his constant bombast is sleep,

[17:51]
and even then, sometimes...

[17:53]
[bomb whistling, explodes]

[17:54]
-[Diane gasps] -[people scream nearby]

[17:58]
Everybody-- Those of you who can walk, I mean.

[18:01]
--let's drag these corpses to the mass grave behind the playground.

[18:04]
We need to make room for my new hospital.

[18:07]
-Where's Kinko? Is he okay? -Oh, no, no, he's certainly dead.

[18:10]
See, Diane, I told you not to make friends.

[18:13]
Jesus, you don't care about any of these people.

[18:15]
You're just using them as props for your big-shot superhero act.

[18:19]
Diane, the dead will not benefit from our grief,

[18:21]
but the survivors need a new hospital and we need to build it.

[18:26]
This is too much.

[18:27]
If you're going to survive, you'll need to harden up.

[18:29]
I asked you to join me because I thought you could handle it.

[18:32]
-But if you can't, you can go home. -I...

[18:35]
I can handle it.

[18:37]
Great! Let's drag some bodies! Kinko! Oh, never mind.

[18:41]
Hey, um, how come Nixon gets a line and I don't get a line?

[18:45]
We only gave him a line so he wouldn't call the police.

[18:47]
-If I call the police, will I get a line? -No, we won't use it in the movie.

[18:51]
We only need the one-shot of me.

[18:53]
I just think if he gets a line, I should get a line.

[18:56]
-Ugh. Actors. -Okay, positions everyone. And... action.

[19:00]
[as Nixon] I'm Nixon.

[19:01]
The way you're feeling about your dead brother is how I feel

[19:04]
about the son I'll never know.

[19:06]
But I look at the moon and so does he. That's how I know we're connected.

[19:11]
And I'm Checkers.

[19:13]
[Kelsey] All right, so, BoJack,

[19:14]
you've been told that your brother, Jeffretariat,

[19:17]
the one Nixon sent to Vietnam in your place, is dead.

[19:20]
You're feeling the weight of that guilt.

[19:22]
And the tears start to flow.

[19:26]
And the tears start to flow.

[19:27]
Oh. I don't cry in front of other people.

[19:30]
Well, you need to. This is the emotional climax of the movie.

[19:33]
Yeah, okay, but I don't cry in front of other people. I can't.

[19:37]
Really, never? Come on.

[19:38]
What if someone tells you they'll take you to the park,

[19:40]
and they keep talking about the park and all the fun you'll have,

[19:43]
but then... [sobs]

[19:44]
But then they don't take you to the park. I need a second.

[19:47]
Well, I'm sorry, I can't do it. I didn't know you wanted me to cry.

[19:51]
Can you give us the room, please?

[19:55]
There's a park right outside we can hang out at.

[19:57]
-Oh! -Oh, we can't, the sprinklers are on.

[20:00]
Ah.

[20:03]
Well, another beautiful, serene day in magical fantasy-painting world.

[20:08]
[sighs]

[20:09]
Queen Princess Carolyn, if I may, I have some exciting news.

[20:12]
I just landed a new client.

[20:14]
-The mill owner! -Huh?

[20:15]
We're doing a three-picture deal about his waterwheel.

[20:18]
-Wait, you're making deals here? -I'll say.

[20:20]
I'm now the biggest agent in the entire idyllic New England village.

[20:24]
It's like you don't even read the idyllic New England village trades.

[20:27]
What? No!

[20:29]
You're polluting my perfect serene dream life. Why is this happening?

[20:32]
I don't know. It's your fantasy.

[20:34]
But if you ask me, I don't think you want perfect and serene

[20:37]
and enough time to catch up on The Good Wife.

[20:39]
Stop kidding yourself, Princess Carolyn.

[20:41]
If you really wanted the simple life, you'd have a simple life.

[20:45]
Oh, my God. I gotta get out of here.

[20:47]
[sing-song] Bye!

[20:50]
Hey. Yeah, I got rid of her. Now this place is all mine.

[20:53]
Get your demo guys together.

[20:55]
Let's tear this old Tudor down and put up some condos! [chuckles]

[20:59]
Okay.

[21:01]
[Margo laughing]

[21:04]
This isn't just for me.

[21:05]
It's for John Carroll Lynch, C.C.H. Pounder,

[21:08]
and all the other character actors who live in lucrative obscurity.

[21:13]
The blood I spill today is for us all!

[21:16]
I'm character actress Margo Martindale! [chuckles]

[21:21]
Yeah, I'm going to go with Princess Carolyn.

[21:24]
[laughing and grunting]

[21:28]
Hmm.

[21:29]
[cell phone ringtone]

[21:31]
-Hello? -Hey.

[21:33]
There you are! I've been trying to call you all week.

[21:35]
-Yeah, the coverage in Cordovia is-- -Diane, Diane.

[21:38]
Listen, I gotta tell you:

[21:39]
I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time about your trip.

[21:42]
The truth is, I really am so proud of you.

[21:46]
A lot of people talk big,

[21:47]
but you're actually out there helping people.

[21:50]
You're the real deal, Diane.

[21:51]
-Yeah... -How is it there? Is it amazing?

[21:54]
It's... good.

[21:56]
It's hard, but it's good.

[22:00]
I miss you.

[22:01]
I miss you, too, but I promise,

[22:03]
these six months are gonna fly by.

[22:06]
Yeah. How's the game show going?

[22:08]
Oh, shit, I completely forgot I'm supposed to be hosting a game show right now.

[22:12]
[upbeat dance music playing]

[22:18]
[caws]

[22:20]
I gotta go.

[22:22]
[Diane] And that's when you realize

[22:23]
that the book you've been writing in your head

[22:26]
is never actually going to be a book, so you stop--

[22:34]
I know what you're gonna say.

[22:35]
I'm a dumb sitcom actor who's in over his head.

[22:39]
I'm sorry that I thought I could do this.

[22:41]
And I'm sorry I made you come here.

[22:43]
I'm sorry for everything. I don't know what I'm doing.

[22:46]
BoJack, sit down.

[22:48]
[sighs]

[22:50]
You've just been told your brother is dead and that it's your fault.

[22:53]
But this moment is bigger than that.

[22:55]
This is the moment that Secretariat stops running.

[22:59]
Because this is the moment you realize

[23:01]
something inside you is broken, and it can never be fixed.

[23:09]
We got it.

[23:11]
Really? I didn't cry.

[23:12]
You didn't have to. Turteltaub's gonna love this.

[23:15]
-Oh. All right. -Thanks for talking me into this.

[23:18]
Just so you know, I'm really glad we're making this movie together.

[23:23]
-Didn't know I had it in me, did you? -No, I knew.

[23:27]
Huh.

[23:37]
[crying]

[23:46]
-Hold the elevator, please. -Coming in?

[23:49]
-I'm all in. -Whoa!

[23:55]
Mommy, it's nearly Christmas. Where's Uncle Secretariat?

[23:58]
He had to go win a race against the Russians.

[24:01]
But maybe, if he runs really fast...

[24:04]
-Hey, where's Kelsey? -Oh, yeah, funny story.

[24:07]
Turns out you two knuckleheads snuck out last night

[24:09]
and got that shot I told you not to get for the scene

[24:12]
-that's not in the movie anymore. -Uh...

[24:14]
Silly me, I didn't like that. So I fired her ass.

[24:16]
-What? -We got a movie to finish, okay?

[24:18]
So, go get in costume,

[24:20]
get your butt up that chimney, and do your thing, Hamlet.

[24:22]
Just maybe, all we have to do is believe!

[24:27]
[slurping]

[24:37]
What are you doing here?

[24:38]
Hey, is it cool if I crash here for a couple nights?

[24:42]
I didn't know where else to go.
