[00:10]
What are you doing here?

[00:12]
You said if I was in town to give you a call.

[00:15]
-Wanna get a drink? -It's eight in the morning.

[00:18]
It's 5:00 p.m. in Los Angeles.

[00:19]
-That's not true. -I don't know what time it is.

[00:22]
When's the last time you slept? You look like shit.

[00:24]
Really? 'Cause you look like a million...

[00:28]
-Yeah, let's get you back to my place. -What about the store?

[00:31]
What if somebody has an emergency and they need more...

[00:33]
turquoise shit?

[00:35]
It's New Mexico.

[00:36]
They'll find it.

[00:37]
-It's really good to see you. -It's good to see you, too.

[00:40]
I can't wait for you to meet Kyle and the kids.

[00:42]
Kyle and the kids? Please tell me that's the name of your band.

So, who are you again?

[01:22]
You were friends with Mom when she lived in L.A.?

[01:24]
Your mom never mentioned she used to hang out with the BoJack Horseman?

[01:28]
Star of screen and... book?

[01:30]
-Wait, Mom lived in Los Angeles? -Never came up?

[01:33]
-All these years? -It was a long time ago.

[01:35]
Oh, gross. Mom, Trip has a boner again.

[01:38]
-Trip. -Trip, let's dial back the boners.

[01:40]
-Gross. -What? I can't help it.

[01:41]
-Trip, ew. -You are at the breakfast table

[01:43]
with your parents, your big sister, and an old man.

[01:46]
-What could possibly be arousing you? -Am I the old man?

[01:49]
I don't understand how it works.

[01:51]
I was just excited that I finished the maze on the back of the cereal box.

[01:54]
So, BoJack. What brings you to Tesuque?

[01:56]
So, we're just gonna change the subject

[01:58]
and pretend Trip isn't being a huge perv right now?

[02:01]
Yeah, Penny, that's the plan.

[02:03]
Talking about it makes it worse. It likes attention.

[02:05]
Charlotte told me if I was ever in New Mexico

[02:07]
-I should call her. -But what are you doing in New Mexico?

[02:10]
-Yeah, what are you doing in New Mexico? -I, uh...

[02:13]
You didn't drive all this way just to see my mom, did you?

[02:16]
[laughs] No, of course not.

[02:18]
That would be crazy,

[02:20]
to come all this way just to see a woman

[02:22]
I haven't had a real conversation with in 30 years.

[02:25]
-I mean, obviously, that would be crazy. -Uh...

[02:28]
-Because she has a family, which is great. -Yeah.

[02:31]
-You guys are great. -Yeah.

[02:33]
So, I'm just here to, you know, say hello.

[02:36]
-Mm. -On my way to see...

[02:39]
-On your way to sea? -Yes.

[02:40]
To the sea. To the shining sea.

[02:43]
Because I'm here to buy... a boat.

[02:45]
-At the... Santa Fe Boat Show. -I've never heard of a Santa Fe Boat Show.

[02:49]
That's 'cause... it's a secret boat show.

[02:51]
-Invitation-only. -Huh.

[02:52]
Mostly athletes and visiting dignitaries and big-time celebrities and... kings.

[02:57]
-Wow. -[Penny] Hold up.

[02:58]
If you live in Los Angeles, which is right on the ocean,

[03:02]
why would you drive all the way here to go to a boat show

[03:04]
-in the middle of landlocked New Mexico? -Jeez, so many questions.

[03:07]
What is this, Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities,

[03:10]
What Do They Know, Do They Know Things, Let's Find Out?

[03:12]
[cell phone ringing]

[03:13]
Oh, gotta take this. It's my... boat... guy.

[03:16]
-Hello? -Okay, so I got Turtel--

[03:18]
Hey, Knute.

[03:19]
-You got any leads for me, boat-wise? -What?

[03:22]
Sounds perfect, Knute.

[03:23]
-Now tell me, do we need a poop deck? -Huh?

[03:26]
-Well, if Leo has one, then I want one. -BoJack--

[03:29]
In fact, I want two, two poop decks. Sorry about that. What's going on?

[03:33]
-Where the hell are you? -Tesuque.

[03:35]
-Te-who-ka? -Tesuque, New Mexico.

[03:37]
-Outside Santa Fe. -Are you te-stupid?

[03:39]
If you don't get your ass back te-set, you're gonna get te-sued.

[03:43]
-Just get me a couple of days. -For what? What are you doing there?

[03:46]
I don't know, I just... [sighs]

[03:47]
This isn't what I expected.

[03:49]
Well, I can probably stave them off till Monday if you get pinkeye.

[03:52]
-Can you get pinkeye? -I have to go.

[03:54]
Wait, BoJack, when are you coming back?

[03:56]
Soon. Yep, I want the starboard

[03:58]
-to be fully starboard. -What?

[04:00]
-And the port to be... also starboard. -Huh?

[04:03]
-Thanks a lot. Goodbye. -Wait, BoJack--

[04:05]
-Hey. -I'm really glad you're here.

[04:07]
Oh, yeah... uh, me, too.

[04:09]
I hope this isn't weird for you.

[04:11]
You know, me having a family and--

[04:13]
Why would it be weird? [chuckles]

[04:14]
At our age, it's weird if you don't have a family.

[04:18]
-I mean... -Well, not for you.

[04:19]
-No. -'Cause you've been busy.

[04:21]
-Right. -With your career.

[04:22]
Sure, yeah, my career has kept me super busy.

[04:26]
Anyway, I know you're just in town for the boat show,

[04:28]
but seriously... make yourself at home.

[04:30]
I really don't want to impose.

[04:32]
If there's anything I can do to help around here--

[04:34]
Mom, Dad was supposed to take me driving after school today,

[04:38]
but now he's gotta take Trip to his dumb-ass basketball game.

[04:41]
-It's the quarter-finals. -You'll just get a hard-on in the game.

[04:44]
Now I will get a hard-on because you made me think about it. Thanks a lot.

[04:48]
-I'll take you driving this weekend. -I need to practice every day.

[04:51]
I'm the only senior who still doesn't have a license.

[04:53]
It's embarrassing.

[04:55]
Well, I got the store, and I already took the morning off,

[04:58]
so unless you know any other adults...

[05:00]
Can BoJack take me?

[05:01]
-Huh? -What?

[05:02]
-I mean, he is an adult. -Uh...

[05:03]
Well, I mean, if it's okay with BoJack.

[05:05]
You'd really be doing me a huge favor.

[05:08]
Well, I guess I could make some time... before the boat show.

[05:16]
Keep your eyes on the road, both hands on the wheel.

[05:19]
-Okay. -And don't text and drive,

[05:21]
unless it's an emergency,

[05:22]
like you have a really funny thing that you just have to text someone.

[05:25]
-Got it. -So, let me ask you something. Tsk.

[05:28]
Do your parents really love each other,

[05:30]
or is it a stay-together-for-the-kids situation?

[05:33]
What? Why would you ask me that?

[05:35]
I don't know. Just making conversation.

[05:37]
-Why do we keep passing the same house? -No, I don't. Shut up.

[05:40]
You shut up. What's the story? Cute guy live there? Girl you hate?

[05:43]
College kid that gives you Adderall?

[05:44]
Okay, fine.

[05:46]
That's Diego Mendoza's house.

[05:48]
He's just this stupid guy.

[05:50]
He's in my calculus class, and sometimes we'll do this thing

[05:53]
where he goes, "Hey," and then I go, "Hey."

[05:55]
Then he goes, "What's the homework?" and I tell him.

[05:58]
It's not like a big deal or anything, but it's like this thing we do.

[06:01]
-Cool thing. -So, anyway...

[06:04]
My best friend, Alison F. was talking to Rachel Kaplan.

[06:06]
[BoJack] Do I really need to know these names?

[06:08]
[Penny] Rachel heard from Ray-Ray and the Bean

[06:10]
that Diego said if prom happened right now

[06:12]
he'd want to go with Ali Sandler, and I'm like,

[06:14]
"Yeah, pfft, okay, dude." You know what I mean?

[06:17]
You know I don't know any of these people, right?

[06:19]
But then he said since prom's not for another two months,

[06:22]
he could "foresee a situation" where he would want to go with me,

[06:25]
because he knows I'm a real girl who's mostly chill. [chuckles]

[06:29]
If you're so mostly chill, why do you keep driving by his house?

[06:32]
In case he comes out, to, like, check the mail or something.

[06:35]
I'll get out of the car and be like, "That's so funny.

[06:37]
I was just going for a drive."

[06:39]
And he'll be like, "Oh, hey." And I'll be like, "Hey."

[06:42]
-'Cause that's our thing, you know? Heh. -That's the whole plan?

[06:45]
Well, it's better than your plan for buying a boat in New Mexico.

[06:49]
Dude, what are you really doing here?

[06:52]
[BoJack sighs]

[06:54]
I didn't... like the person I was in L.A.

[06:59]
And I didn't know where else to go.

[07:02]
-Please do not tell your parents. -Well, I won't,

[07:05]
but I think people are gonna notice

[07:06]
if you go to a boat show and don't come back with a boat.

[07:09]
[BoJack sighs]

[07:10]
Oh, my God, there he is. Get down!

[07:12]
-Oh, my God. Oh! -What are you doing?

[07:13]
-What happened to your plan? -Oh! I panicked.

[07:16]
I didn't know he'd be wearing a tank top. [screams]

[07:21]
-Don't tell my parents I crashed your car. -Yeah, deal.

[07:28]
-They didn't even put me in. -[sighs] I'm sorry, sweetheart.

[07:31]
You did some great cheering from the bench,

[07:33]
and for someone who never plays, you sweat a lot.

[07:35]
-Maybe they'll put me in next game. -Sure, they will.

[07:38]
[whispering] No way they'll do that.

[07:39]
[truck beeping]

[07:40]
-[Kyle in normal voice] What the...? -Huh?

[07:43]
-Whoa! -Whoa!

[07:44]
What a boat.

[07:46]
-Can I go on your boat? -I don't see what's stopping you.

[07:48]
Yeah! Woo-hoo! I'm going on a boat! I got my way!

[07:51]
Where's your car?

[07:52]
I junked it. Who needs a car when you got a boat?

[07:55]
-Uh... well-- -[Trip] Whoa, sweet, a waterbed.

[07:58]
On a boat! Think of the amount of floating!

[08:01]
Please stay out of the bedroom.

[08:03]
-Does she have a name? -Who?

[08:04]
-The boat? It does not. -Come on. You gotta give her a name.

[08:08]
You should call her the Escape From L.A.

[08:10]
That actually is a good name for it, the nongendered object.

[08:13]
Oh, she's a good girl.

[08:15]
[chuckles] I can tell, she's a good girl, isn't she?

[08:18]
-Or are you a bad girl? -Are you flirting with my boat right now?

[08:21]
No, just kidding around. I'm kind of the comedian of the family.

[08:24]
-Mind if I get on top of her? -Knock yourself out.

[08:27]
Dad, don't be gross.

[08:28]
-Wow, you really got a boat. -Yeah, sure did.

[08:31]
So, does that mean you're leaving?

[08:33]
Oh, I, uh...

[08:34]
Yeah, I guess, uh... I guess I did... do what I came here to do.

[08:39]
You don't have to go right away, right? At least stay till the end of the weekend.

[08:42]
-Yeah? I don't wanna put you out. -Oh, it's no bother.

[08:45]
And at least now you have your own bed. Besides... heh, everyone here loves you.

[08:49]
Uh, everyone?

[08:51]
[Kyle] Don't use the bathroom. It'll end up in the driveway.

[08:53]
-[Trip] Too late. -Seriously, stay as long as you want.

[08:58]
[cell phone rings]

[08:59]
-What? -BoJack, great news.

[09:01]
Do you still want to go to New York? Because Jill Pill--

[09:04]
Jill Pill? I don't care about this.

[09:06]
Okay, moving on. Do you remember when we were at Herb's funeral

[09:09]
-and you told me--? -Whatever it is, I don't care.

[09:11]
[Trip] Oh, there's a kitchen! Can we make pizza bagels?

[09:13]
[Kyle] Yeah, family dinner on the boat.

[09:15]
[family laughs]

[09:16]
Hey, uh, I'm not gonna be back on set Monday.

[09:18]
What? How long do I have to keep putting out fires for you?

[09:22]
I don't know, Princess Carolyn. Just let them burn.

[09:24]
-What? -I think I might be here a while.

[09:27]
Listen, I--

[09:29]
[grunts]

[09:31]
[sighs]

[09:33]
Well, who's getting seasick? [retches]

[09:35]
[family laughs]

[09:36]
Just kidding. [chuckles]

[09:39]
It's such an eyesore.

[09:41]
Well, I'm sure if we ask them nicely, they'll move the boat.

[09:50]
[husband sighs]

[09:51]
BoJack?

[09:52]
-Yeah? -Supper's ready.

[09:54]
So, I had another meeting today with the Drama Chair at SFCC.

[09:58]
They're gonna offer me a position.

[10:00]
-What? That's amazing. -Oh, that's cool. Congratulations.

[10:03]
There's a real stick-in-the-mud dean there who doesn't like my in-your-face style.

[10:07]
If I know me, it might lead to some pretty zany misadventures.

[10:12]
Mm. Brussels sprouts are delicious, Mom.

[10:13]
It's funny you brought up the Brussels sprouts, because I think they're terrible.

[10:18]
[Kyle snorts, then laughs]

[10:19]
I'm just kidding around. These are great, hon.

[10:21]
[all laugh]

[10:22]
Penny, did you hear my bit about the Brussels sprouts?

[10:25]
A bit is what they call a joke in show business.

[10:28]
-Right, BoJack? -That's right.

[10:29]
String a bunch of those together and you got yourself a riff.

[10:32]
[groans] You're not funny, Dad. Your jokes are never funny.

[10:35]
Okay... I think someone's in a mood.

[10:37]
Oh, my God. I'm not in a mood.

[10:39]
Whatever. Get bent.

[10:41]
I hate my life. I can't wait to be dead.

[10:43]
[door slams]

[10:44]
[BoJack and Charlotte] I'll talk to her.

[10:46]
Everyone said for months

[10:47]
-that Diego was gonna ask me to prom. -Yeah?

[10:49]
-But he keeps not doing it. -That is so typical Diego.

[10:52]
So, I thought, okay, if he's not going to ask me, I'll ask him.

[10:55]
-Way to take initiative. -Oh. Rookie mistake.

[10:57]
So, I asked him and he said no.

[10:58]
And then this other girl, Lyla K., came up to him and was just like, "Hey."

[11:02]
And he was like, "Hey." And that's our thing.

[11:05]
Well, I don't want to tell tales out of school,

[11:07]
but this Lyla K. character sounds like a real bust-ass super-skank.

[11:11]
Thank you, that is exactly what she is. It's weird that nobody talks about it.

[11:15]
Well, you know, sometimes it's nice to not have a date,

[11:18]
-because you can actually-- -Mom.

[11:19]
I can't go to the prom without a date. It's not like when you were in high school

[11:23]
-and you'd go to your sock hops. -Do you think

[11:26]
-I went to high school in the '50s? -Penny, hey, I got an idea.

[11:29]
-You should take me to the prom. -Huh?

[11:30]
Everybody loves having BoJack around.

[11:32]
What? Why?

[11:34]
Think about it. If you went with Diego, you'd be nervous.

[11:36]
"Does he like me? Am I cool?"

[11:38]
But with me you can just relax and enjoy yourself.

[11:41]
Diego will see you have a good time without him,

[11:43]
and that'll make him super jealous.

[11:45]
So, he'll come up to you, and he'll say, "Hey."

[11:47]
And then you say, "Hey."

[11:49]
-Oh, that's so cold. -Right?

[11:51]
-Wait-- -Rachel Kaplan's gonna shit herself.

[11:54]
-How is that cold? -Then he'll say, "Wanna dance?"

[11:56]
And you'll say, "I'm busy right now. Maybe later."

[11:58]
And then... never dance with him.

[12:01]
-That'll show him. -Wait-- I'm sorry.

[12:04]
-Don't you want to dance with Diego? -Stop poking holes, Charlotte.

[12:06]
-This is a great plan. -Yeah, Mom, don't poke holes.

[12:09]
Hey, Dad, BoJack's taking me to prom!

[12:12]
Oh, [chuckles] yeah, well, that's definitely the better idea.

[12:18]
[Kyle] Okay, everyone smile. Real big.

[12:20]
-[all] Cheese. -I think we have enough pictures.

[12:23]
Oh, come on, it's your first prom. Indulge us.

[12:25]
Taking pictures before prom is so bourgeois.

[12:28]
And who are you again?

[12:29]
-I'm Maddy. -Maddy's my best friend.

[12:31]
-I thought Alison F. was your best friend. -That was like three best friends ago.

[12:36]
[snickers] You were best friends with Alison F.?

[12:40]
-No. -Hey, BoJack, I'm Pete.

[12:43]
But they call me Pete Repeat because I always say everything twice.

[12:47]
-Everything? -Yeah, it's kind of my thing.

[12:50]
-Okay. -Ah, damn.

[12:51]
I forgot to say that twice, didn't I? Usually I do it.

[12:54]
Cool.

[12:55]
[rock music playing over stereo]

[12:58]
Wow, Ray-Ray and the Bean are already posting pics on Instagram.

[13:01]
-What? -Hashtag much?

[13:03]
Let me see.

[13:04]
Whoa, hold on. Responsible adult.

[13:06]
-What are you drinking? -Nothing.

[13:08]
-Hand it over. -[scoffs] Fine.

[13:11]
Ugh. Red Bull and vodka? What are you, 12? You'll get sick drinking all that sugar.

[13:15]
Do they teach you anything in school? Make a left at the light.

[13:18]
-Where are we going? -I'll get you some bourbon.

[13:20]
And you'll cut it with water. That way you don't get hungover.

[13:23]
Wait, really?

[13:25]
If you're gonna drink, you should be smart about it.

[13:27]
Awesome. Wait. How many times did I just say "awesome"?

[13:30]
Was it twice or was it once? Ah, it was probably twice.

[13:33]
Yeah, it's twice. Pete Repeat.

[13:35]
[hip-hop music playing over speakers]

[13:39]
[opossum screeches]

[13:41]
-Ugh. It burns. -Yeah, 'cause it's not a juice box.

[13:44]
You want some?

[13:45]
-No, thanks. -[coughing] Pussy.

[13:47]
I'm driving.

[13:48]
Well, more for me.

[13:49]
This prom is really bourgeois.

[13:51]
-Lyla K. is so pretty. -Shut up. She's got nothing on you.

[13:55]
Why is nobody dancing? We gotta get this party started.

[13:59]
[sighs]

[14:00]
Beat it, Poindexter.

[14:01]
-Poindexter? -It's a nerd reference... [sighs]

[14:03]
-Just beat it. -Ah!

[14:04]
-[feedback squeaks] -Huh?

[14:05]
-Hey! -What's the big idea?

[14:06]
Why is there an adult at our high school prom?

[14:10]
All right, folks. We're taking it back to 1991,

[14:12]
when a new funky-fresh dance craze took this nation by storm.

[14:16]
-All right. [chuckles] -I'm listening.

[14:17]
As a teen, I'm open to new experiences.

[14:20]
Ready for the chorus, stay on the beat, and here... we... go. Waka waka.

[14:24]
Now boys and girls, if you wanna do the BoJack,

[14:27]
-take your hands and put them on your-- -Boo!

[14:29]
-This sucks. -This guy's bad.

[14:31]
God, no! This is not the immediate praise I expected.

[14:34]
[R &amp; B ballad playing over speakers]

[14:35]
[students cheering]

[14:37]
This prom sucks.

[14:39]
You can say that again.

[14:40]
-I know. -[slurring] My flask got empty.

[14:42]
Can we be back to the car, so, for more get for put in it?

[14:46]
Or we could go back to the car and just leave.

[14:48]
-You can't just leave the prom. -Of course you can. You're young.

[14:51]
You can do whatever you want.

[14:53]
That's what they never tell you

[14:54]
until it's too late. You don't have to be here.

[14:57]
Yeah, is right. Society is everywhere.

[15:00]
-Society. -Well, what else are we gonna do?

[15:03]
I'd say it's time to get down, time to hit the town.

[15:05]
Is that a lyric from that "Do the BoJack" song?

[15:08]
Just get in the car.

[15:18]
[Penny laughs]

[15:20]
Okay, one... two... three.

[15:26]
[Penny] Wow. That is so beautiful.

[15:29]
[Maddy burps]

[15:30]
Hey, you wanna climb up on the water tower?

[15:32]
We could see the whole city.

[15:34]
Yeah, I wanna go.

[15:36]
-[Maddy vomits] -Oh.

[15:37]
Oh, careful there, Maddy.

[15:39]
Actually, I'm gonna stay right here.

[15:41]
This is nice.

[15:43]
[both grunting]

[15:44]
Wow, how'd you think to do all this?

[15:47]
I don't know. It just came to me.

[15:49]
I'm really glad we left that stupid prom,

[15:52]
but I'm kind of bummed we didn't get to dance.

[15:55]
Well, you wanna dance?

[15:57]
Yes, hold on.

[15:59]
Got it, okay.

[16:00]
[pop ballad playing haltingly over phone]

[16:02]
It's buffering.

[16:04]
Buffering still, buffering.

[16:08]
This night has been... so perfect.

[16:11]
You know, you look just like your mother.

[16:15]
[Pete] Guys?

[16:17]
I think you should come down here.

[16:19]
She's still breathing, but she won't wake up.

[16:22]
She just had too much to drink. Take her back to your place.

[16:25]
-She can spend the night. -Maddy, come on.

[16:27]
No, look, my cousin had a friend who passed out like this,

[16:30]
and she died of alcohol poisoning, man.

[16:33]
I really think we should get Maddy to a hospital, to a hospital.

[16:36]
Did you see what I did there? That's why they call me Pete Repeat.

[16:39]
BoJack, what do we do?

[16:43]
[tires screech]

[16:47]
-Society. -Careful.

[16:49]
-I'm being careful. -Okay.

[16:50]
-Lock the wheels. -Watch her head.

[16:52]
Maddy's gonna be just fine. They'll know what to do here.

[16:54]
Pete, you're in charge.

[16:56]
-Penny and I are gonna take off. -What?

[16:58]
You don't want too many people around in a hospital setting.

[17:01]
If anyone asks, tell them we left the dance early,

[17:03]
and you don't know where Maddy got the whiskey.

[17:06]
Why?

[17:07]
It's one thing if a bunch of kids get drunk on prom night,

[17:09]
but if there's an adult there, I was supposed to be responsible,

[17:12]
and then the whole thing feels kind of creepy.

[17:15]
Are you sure she's gonna be okay?

[17:16]
-I don't know, BoJack. -Pete.

[17:18]
I'm the adult here, and I need you to listen to me.

[17:21]
Penny and I left early. You don't know who gave Maddy whiskey.

[17:24]
Are we clear on this?

[17:25]
I need you to be 100 percent with me here.

[17:27]
Uh...

[17:28]
Just listen to him. He knows what he's doing.

[17:30]
It's gonna be okay. Where did Maddy get the alcohol from?

[17:32]
[Maddy groaning]

[17:33]
I... I don't know.

[17:35]
And what happened to your friends BoJack and Penny?

[17:38]
[sighs] They left early.

[17:40]
See, that's not so hard.

[17:42]
You're doing the right thing. Don't forget that.

[17:45]
[Pete sighs]

[17:46]
-Okay. -Is it okay?

[17:49]
Or "okay" okay?

[17:51]
-Uh... "okay" okay. -All right, that's what I thought.

[17:54]
You're the future of America! Go, Penny! Go, go, go!

[17:57]
[tires screech]

[18:00]
-She's gonna be okay, right? -She'll be fine.

[18:02]
It's a part of growing up.

[18:04]
And we did the right thing back there, you think?

[18:07]
I... [sighs] Look, sometimes when you're an adult,

[18:10]
the right thing isn't always the best thing.

[18:12]
Well...

[18:14]
I had a really good time tonight.

[18:17]
Even with all the craziness.

[18:19]
This was really special.

[18:21]
I'm glad.

[18:22]
You know, everyone always treats me like a kid.

[18:25]
You're the first grown-up I've ever met who actually treats me like...

[18:29]
you know, a person.

[18:30]
So, thanks. Mwah.

[18:33]
-Well, you're welcome, Penny. -Mm--

[18:35]
-Whoa, Penny, come on. -If you want to do it, I'm ready.

[18:38]
I have condoms in my room. I can put one on with my mouth.

[18:41]
-With your mouth? -I put one on a banana in health class.

[18:43]
With your mouth? What kind of health class--?

[18:46]
Look, you are an amazing person, but you're 17.

[18:49]
Which is the legal age of consent in New Mexico.

[18:51]
Okay, that's not--

[18:52]
And I didn't drink tonight, so everything's totally legal.

[18:55]
-Penny, no. -It's okay. I want this.

[18:58]
No, you think you do, but...

[19:01]
You don't know what you want.

[19:04]
Oh, God. [sniffs]

[19:06]
This is so dumb.

[19:08]
-No, Penny, don't-- -I'll see you tomorrow.

[19:11]
[sighs]

[19:17]
Hey.

[19:19]
-What'd you do with my daughter? -She had a big night.

[19:21]
She was falling asleep on the ride home. Where are the boys?

[19:24]
Trip's at a friend's house and Kyle's asleep.

[19:28]
-You know you can get your own, right? -Hey, do you remember that time

[19:31]
you, me and Herb let those balloons go over Studio City?

[19:34]
Oh, yeah. Didn't we attach glow sticks to them or something?

[19:37]
-Yeah. -Ooh. That was really bad

[19:38]
for the environment.

[19:39]
-True, but-- -A seagull could've choked

[19:41]
-on one of those balloons. -But it's a nice memory, right?

[19:44]
It was a fun night.

[19:46]
We had a lot of fun nights.

[19:48]
Before you left town, you told me L.A. was a tar pit.

[19:51]
-Do you remember? -Oh, God.

[19:53]
I said so many things when I was young. I thought I was so deep.

[19:56]
-Well, do you still think it's true? -Do I think L.A. is a tar pit?

[20:00]
No.

[20:01]
No, I think you're the tar pit.

[20:03]
-Me? -No, not "you" you.

[20:06]
I'm just saying, like...

[20:08]
It doesn't matter where you are, it's who you are,

[20:11]
and that's not gonna change whether you're in California

[20:14]
or Maine or New Mexico.

[20:17]
You know, you can't escape... you.

[20:19]
-Ugh. Now you sound like my mother. -No, what? No, I don't. [laughs]

[20:24]
[Charlotte sighs]

[20:27]
-I don't know what to do, Charlotte. -About what?

[20:30]
I keep... making these bad decisions.

[20:33]
-And hurting people. -Well...

[20:36]
-Can I tell you a joke? -Is it a long joke with no punch line?

[20:39]
-No. -Then go ahead.

[20:41]
Guy goes into the doctor's office. Says, "Doctor, it hurts when I do this."

[20:45]
You know what the doctor says?

[20:46]
-"Don't do that." -Yeah.

[20:49]
-That's actually... good advice. -And you know what else?

[20:52]
The doctor in that story was a woman.

[20:55]
What?!

[20:56]
[BoJack laughs]

[21:02]
[both moan]

[21:04]
[Charlotte gasps]

[21:05]
Oh. BoJack, um...

[21:07]
-I think you got the wrong idea. -Let's go.

[21:10]
-Let's get out of here right now. -No, BoJack.

[21:12]
You and me, this is real.

[21:14]
-You know this is real. -My husband is right upstairs.

[21:16]
I don't care about your husband. All that matters is us.

[21:19]
-Don't do this, BoJack. -I know you feel it, too.

[21:22]
So many times in my life I've done the wrong thing,

[21:24]
but this is the right thing,

[21:26]
and I have never been more sure of anything.

[21:28]
I've wasted so much time sitting on my hands

[21:30]
and imagining what could have been.

[21:33]
Tell me you don't feel the same. Tell me you haven't thought about it.

[21:37]
[Charlotte sighs]

[21:39]
-I think you should go. -Okay.

[21:41]
-Tomorrow. -Charlotte--

[21:42]
I have worked very hard to build this life for myself.

[21:44]
I am happy here.

[21:45]
And you just roll into my life like a hurricane.

[21:48]
Why? Because we knew each other for five minutes 30 years ago?

[21:52]
-I don't know you. -You do.

[21:53]
I don't. And you don't know me.

[21:55]
No, please. These last few months have been amazing.

[21:58]
-I love you, your family and this town. -Stop.

[22:00]
-I never wanted to hurt-- -BoJack--

[22:02]
I'm sorry I kissed you. I shouldn't have. We can pretend it didn't happen.

[22:06]
-Everything can go back to normal, but-- -No, no, stop. No.

[22:09]
Please, don't make me go back to L.A.

[22:11]
I don't care where you go, BoJack, but I can't have you around here.

[22:15]
You make me too sad.

[22:19]
Okay.

[22:25]
What are you doing here?

[22:26]
I know what I want, BoJack.

[22:32]
Go to bed, Penny.

[22:44]
[sighing]

[22:49]
Wait, what?

[22:56]
[clattering from inside]

[22:57]
[Penny whispering] Shh, shh, shh. Quiet, quiet, quiet.

[23:07]
[Penny gasps]

[23:08]
-No. -Mom.

[23:09]
-Charlotte. -Penny, go to your room.

[23:11]
-We didn't even do anything. -Now, Penny.

[23:15]
[Penny crying]

[23:17]
-Charlotte, I am so sorry-- -Don't. Don't you dare.

[23:21]
If you are not out of my driveway in 30 minutes, I will call the police.

[23:25]
And if you ever try to contact me or my family again,

[23:29]
I will fucking kill you.

[23:36]
[♪♪]

[24:20]
[can crunches]

[24:22]
[grunts]

[24:31]
[Diane] Hey.

[24:33]
Hey.

[24:34]
You're still here?

[24:36]
Yep, still here.
