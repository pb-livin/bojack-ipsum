Horsin' Around is filmed before a live studio audience.

[00:13]
[sighs] Mondays.

[00:15]
[laughs] Well, good morning to you too.

Oh, hey.

[00:20]
Where? I'd love hay.

[00:23]
[laughs]

[00:25]
In 1987, the situation comedy Horsin' Around

[00:28]
premiered on ABC.

[00:29]
The show, in which a young, bachelor horse

[00:31]
is forced to reevaluate his priorities

[00:34]
when he agrees to raise three human children,

[00:36]
was initially dismissed by critics

[00:38]
as broad and saccharine and not good,

[00:41]
but the family comedy struck a chord with America

[00:44]
and went on to air for nine seasons.

[00:46]
The star of Horsin' Around, BoJack Horseman,

[00:49]
is our guest tonight.

[00:51]
Welcome, BoJack.

[00:52]
It is good to be here, Charlie.

[00:53]
Sorry I was late. The traffic--

[00:55]
It's really no problem.

[00:56]
I parked in a handicapped spot.

[00:57]
I hope that's okay.

[00:59]
You parked in a--

[01:00]
I'm sorry, disabled spot.

[01:01]
Is that the proper nomenclature?

[01:03]
Maybe you should move the car.

[01:05]
No, I don't think I should drive right now.

[01:06]
I'm incredibly drunk.

[01:08]
You're telling me that you're drunk right now?

[01:11]
Is it just me, or am I nailing this interview?

[01:13]
I kind of feel like I'm nailing it.

[01:14]
Yes.

[01:16]
Anyway, we were talking about Horsin' Around.

[01:19]
To what do you attribute the show's wide appeal?

[01:21]
Charlie, listen, you know,

[01:23]
I know that it's very hip these days

[01:24]
to shit all over Horsin' Around,

[01:26]
but at the time, I can tell you--

[01:27]
- Is it okay to say "shit"? - Please don't.

[01:28]
'Cause I-- I think the show's

[01:30]
actually pretty solid for what it is.

[01:31]
It's not Ibsen, sure,

[01:33]
but look, for a lot of people,

[01:34]
life is just one long, hard kick in the urethra,

[01:37]
and sometimes when you get home

[01:39]
from a long day of getting kicked in the urethra,

[01:41]
you just want to watch a show about good, likable people

[01:44]
who love each other,

[01:45]
where, you know, no matter what happens,

[01:47]
at the end of 30 minutes,

[01:48]
everything's gonna turn out okay.

[01:50]
You know, because in real life--

[01:52]
Did I already say the thing about the urethra?

[01:55]
Well, let's talk about real life.

[01:56]
What have you been doing since the show's cancellation

[01:58]
18 years ago?

[02:00]
That's a great question, Charlie.

[02:01]

We're actually in the middle of breaking up right now,

- so if you could just-- - Yeah?

[08:58]
- You're in the middle of it? - Yeah, that's right.

So would it be awkward if I joined you right now?

Why are you making conversation?

Oh, let's see, it's the English word--

[09:16]
It's called being polite, BoJack.

But am I crazy that this is a bad time?

Always a Clydesdale, never a Clyde, eh, BoJack?

What?

You'll get that one later, man.

Erica, get out of here with that face.

Would it kill you to be civil?

[09:28]
This is why we're breaking up.

[09:30]
So it's not because of the thing with the baby?

[09:32]
It's because of a lot of things!

[09:34]
Waiter, could we please have the check?

[09:36]
- Thank you. - We haven't even ordered yet.

[09:37]
I have wasted so many dinners on you, BoJack Horseman.

[09:40]
I don't know how you can expect anyone else to love you

[09:42]
when you so clearly hate yourself.

[09:44]
- Here you go. - Let me see that.

[09:47]
$10 for bread?

[09:50]
I don't want to live in a society

[09:52]
where the premeal bread isn't free.

[09:54]
It is free if you order a meal.

[09:56]
Can you take me home, please?

[09:58]
Yeah, but I didn't even eat that much bread.

[10:00]
What did I have? I must have had--

[10:01]
You ate nine baskets, sir.

[10:03]
Nine-- really?

[10:04]
Great, now I'm gonna feel like a fat ass all week.

[10:08]
You've seen me naked. Do you think I'm getting chubby?

[10:10]
You want to know the real reason we're breaking up?

[10:12]
What was that? Sorry.

[10:13]
Couldn't hear you over the sound of my calories not metabolizing.

[10:15]
This is so classic you.

[10:18]
You're using this bread thing

[10:19]
to avoid talking about our relationship.

[10:21]
No, that is definitely not happening.

[10:23]
I'd like to go home now.

[10:27]
You think I'm fat.

[10:28]
So yeah, technically I was dumped,

[10:30]
but the real headline of the evening was,

[10:32]
"Dumb guy eats bread, gets fat, the end."

[10:35]
What kind of headline is that?

[10:37]
Wasn't there a pizza here a second ago?

[10:39]
God damn it! Stop the presses.

[10:41]
You're not fat.

[10:43]
Oh, hey, let's throw a party. That'll cheer you up.

[10:46]
No, it won't. It'll cheer you up.

[10:49]
I'll stand in the corner by myself

Who told you Princess Carolyn and I broke up?

[11:07]
- She did. - What?

[11:09]
You never took me home, jerk!

[11:11]
Oh, everything's my fault.

[11:12]
Take me home.

[11:14]
Okay, jeez.

But I'm not looking for parking in Silver Lake.

and then crapped out a third pile of crap.

[11:57]
Wait, wait, so which pile of crap do I look like?

[12:00]
- The third one. - What? That's the worst one.

[12:02]

[13:35]
He's kind of my personal hero.

[13:37]
Could never get the project off the ground, though.

[13:40]
I mean, there was this one time I came close in the '90s,

[13:42]
but then those Prefontaine movies came out,

[13:43]
and people got tired of seeing running on-screen.

[13:45]
Don't tell me. Tell her!

[13:49]

What? No!

- Gabriela, why? - Who?

[14:37]
We were talking about me.

[14:38]
Can you try to focus for, like, a second?

[14:40]
Oh, yeah, sorry. You were saying?

Never should have signed this book deal.

[14:44]
You know what my problem is?

[14:45]
I can't say no to people

[14:46]
because I want everyone to like me.

[14:48]
You want everyone to like you?

[14:51]
Yeah, why?

[14:53]
Do people not like me?

[14:54]
Uh...

[15:00]
Uh...

[15:03]
What were we talking about?

[15:04]
I can see the headline now,

[15:06]
"Stupid BoJack writes a stupid book about his stupid life,

[15:10]
nobody cares."

[15:11]
What newspapers are you reading?

[15:13]
Hey, why don't you just let that lady

[15:15]
write your book and be done with it?

[15:16]
Better question, why are you in my kitchen?

[15:18]
I'm making breakfast.

[15:19]
We had sex last night, dummy.

[15:21]
Ugh, I really got to start putting my phone

[15:22]
on airplane mode when I drink.

[15:24]
[hisses]

[15:26]
This lady probably thinks I'm just some dumb sitcom actor.

[15:28]
I hate her and her stupid,

[15:30]
impossible-to-pronounce last name,

[15:31]
Na-goo-ya-go-goo-goo-goo-ga.

[15:33]
You haven't even met her.

[15:34]
Give her a chance.

[15:36]
Oh, you should invite her to the party.

[15:37]
What party?

[15:39]
Why are you so obsessed

[15:40]
with throwing a party all of a sudden?

[15:42]
Ow, ow, ow!

[15:44]
You know how much money we lost 'cause of you?

[15:46]
I can't even afford a hall now for my daughter's [00:00]h birthday,

[15:50]
and now I got a hundred guests coming and nowhere to put them.

[15:53]
You owe me a party, cabrón, and if you don't deliver--

[15:58]
[muffled whimpers]

[15:59]

[16:01]
Because parties are fun?

[16:03]
This book is really important to me.

[16:04]
I don't want to just hand it off to some stranger.

[16:06]
If it's so important, why have you written

[16:08]
literally nothing in a year and a half?

[16:09]
It's too much pressure.

[16:11]
This book is my one shot at preserving my legacy.

[16:14]
I'm a joke, and if this book isn't good,

[16:16]
I'm gonna be a joke forever.

[16:18]
Everyone thinks that I'm just this washed-up hack,

[16:19]
but actually--

[16:21]
Oh, God, actually, what if they're right?

[16:24]
I can't breathe.

Am I dying?

What do you mean he's dead?

[17:07]
That's right, sweetheart.

[17:08]
He died of a broken heart

[17:10]
because you didn't appreciate him enough,

[17:12]

We might have gone too dark on that series finale.

Thanks for inviting me to your party.

Sorry I haven't really been mingling.

he was bringing up three boys of his own.

[21:51]
Right, but--

[21:53]
They were four men living all together,

[21:54]
but they were all alone.

[21:55]
That is profoundly sad.

[21:57]
No, the story is that the guy who played the dad

[22:00]
hated being on The Brady Bunch because he was a real actor,

[22:03]
and he considered it beneath him.

[22:05]
Sound familiar?

[22:06]
That's not all that was beneath him.
