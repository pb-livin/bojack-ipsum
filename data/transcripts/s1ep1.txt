V/O: Horsin' Around is filmed before a live studio audience.

[00:13]
SABRINA: [sighs] Mondays.

[00:15]
BOJACK [ON TV]: [laughs] Well, good morning to you too.

[00:18]
SABRINA: Oh, hey.

BOJACK [ON TV]: Where? I'd love hay. [chuffs]

[00:23]
SABRINA: [laughs]

[00:25]
CHARLIE ROSE: In 1987, the situation comedy Horsin' Around premiered on ABC. The show, in which a young, bachelor horse is forced to reevaluate his priorities when he agrees to raise three human children, was initially dismissed by critics as broad and saccharine and not good, but the family comedy struck a chord with America and went on to air for nine seasons. The star of Horsin' Around, BoJack Horseman, is our guest tonight. Welcome, BoJack.

[00:52]
BOJACK: It is good to be here, Charlie. Sorry I was late. The traffic--

[00:55]
CHARLIE ROSE: It's really no problem.

[00:56]
BOJACK: I parked in a handicapped spot. I hope that's okay.

[00:59]
CHARLIE ROSE: You parked in a--

[01:00]
BOJACK: I'm sorry, disabled spot. Is that the proper nomenclature?

[01:03]
CHARLIE ROSE: Maybe you should move the car.

[01:05]
BOJACK: No, I don't think I should drive right now. I'm incredibly drunk.

[01:08]
CHARLIE ROSE: You're telling me that you're drunk right now?

[01:11]
BOJACK: Is it just me, or am I nailing this interview? I kind of feel like I'm nailing it.

[01:14]
CHARLIE ROSE: Yes. Anyway, we were talking about Horsin' Around. To what do you attribute the show's wide appeal?

[01:21]
BOJACK: Charlie, listen, you know, I know that it's very hip these days to shit all over Horsin' Around, but at the time, I can tell you-- Is it okay to say "shit"?

[01:27]
CHARLIE ROSE: Please don't.

[01:28]
BOJACK: 'Cause I-- I think the show's actually pretty solid for what it is. It's not Ibsen, sure, but look, for a lot of people, life is just one long, hard kick in the urethra, and sometimes when you get home from a long day of getting kicked in the urethra, you just want to watch a show about good, likable people who love each other, where, you know, no matter what happens, at the end of 30 minutes, everything's gonna turn out okay. You know, because in real life-- Did I already say the thing about the urethra?

[01:55]
CHARLIE ROSE: Well, let's talk about real life. What have you been doing since the show's cancellation 18 years ago?

[02:00]
BOJACK: That's a great question, Charlie. I, uh... Uh, I... Um...

BOJACK: It's too much pressure. This book is my one shot at preserving my legacy. I'm a joke, and if this book isn't good, I'm gonna be a joke forever.

CAROLYN: How long is that doctor going to take? I have a meeting with another client at 3:00.

[17:32]
BOJACK: You have other clients?

[17:33]
CAROLYN: No, I make a living off you sitting on your ass all day.

[17:36]
BOJACK: Are your other clients more talented than I am? Your silence speaks volumes.

[17:40]
CAROLYN: [singsong] That was my intention.

[17:42]
PIG DOCTOR: Well, BoJack, it looks like what you experienced was a mild anxiety attack.

[17:47]
BOJACK: Jesus, if that's mild, I don't want to know what spicy feels like. Too smart for the room? It was a salsa joke, people.

[17:54]
PIG DOCTOR: You've been overstressed. I need you to take it easy.

[17:57]
CAROLYN: Take it easy, are you kidding? He doesn't have a job. He has no real responsibilities. He doesn't do anything but take it easy.

[18:03]
PIG DOCTOR: Well, can you take it even easier?

[18:06]
BOJACK: I can try, doctor. I can try.

[18:09]
CAROLYN: This book deal is obviously stressing you out. Will you just call the ghostwriter already?

[18:13]
BOJACK: What, you want me to call this woman on the phone? [gasps]

[18:18]
[TEN MINUTES LATER]

[18:19]
PIG DOCTOR: Well, you just had another anxiety attack.

[18:22]
BOJACK: And Entertainment Weekly said I wasn't consistent. [laughs] Really, not even a pity laugh? I did almost die.

[18:29]
TODD: Ha.

[18:30]
PIG DOCTOR: I have to check on some other patients.

[18:33]
BOJACK: You have other patients?

[18:34]
TODD: BoJack, let's have a party, okay? I'll organize the whole thing. You can invite the ghostwriter and have a nice, casual conversation in a fun, pressure-free environment.

[18:44]
BOJACK: Okay, fine. We'll have a party.

[18:46]
TODD: Oh, thank God.

[18:47]
BOJACK: But we're not getting a cotton candy machine. I can't control myself around those things.

[18:50]
TODD: I totally hear what you are saying, and I will do my best.

BOJACK: Todd, who was that guy? Who are all these people?

[19:19]
TODD: Oh, you know, just a variety of folks from all walks of life.

[19:22]
BOJACK: Is this a quinceañera?

[19:24]
TODD: Oh, so any party with Mexican teenage girls is a quinceañera? Now who's racist?

BOJACK: Oh, okay, yeah.

DIANE: I'm probably just overthinking it because I never got the practice because I didn't get invited to any parties in high school. What am I talking about? You don't care about any of that. Shut up, Diane. You're at a party, compliment the host. You have a lovely home.

BOJACK: Do I know his story? If I recall correctly, he was bringing up three boys of his own.

[21:51]
DIANE: Right, but--

[21:53]
BOJACK: They were four men living all together, but they were all alone. That is profoundly sad.

[21:57]
DIANE: No, the story is that the guy who played the dad hated being on The Brady Bunch because he was a real actor, and he considered it beneath him. Sound familiar?

[22:06]
BOJACK: That's not all that was beneath him. Gay joke. Sorry, I'm better than that.

[22:10]
DIANE: Most people don't even get to do The Brady Bunch version of the thing they want to do with their lives. You're actually in a really good position now, because you can pretty much do anything you want. You're responsible for your own happiness, you know?
