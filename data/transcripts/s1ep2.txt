[00:15]
When.

[00:17]
[woman] Yeah, you'll never guess who's here.

[00:19]
Think '90s.

[00:21]
No, BoJack Horseman from Horsin' Around.

[00:24]
No, I mean, he got a little fatter,

[00:26]
but it's definitely him.

[00:28]
He looks really sad. It's hilarious.

Yeah, probably.

Oh, my God. Take another one.

Take another one.

Excuse me, I just wanted you to know

[01:44]
that you ruined someone else's night tonight,

[01:46]
and I hope you have enough decency

[01:48]
to at least feel a little bit crappy about it.

[01:50]
Excuse me?

[01:52]
I was actually already in a bad mood,

[01:53]
but I thought maybe for one night,

[01:55]
I could go out to a bar and try to forget about myself,

[01:58]
but now because of you and your friends,

[02:00]
I feel more self-conscious than ever.

[02:02]
If we were bothering you so much,

[02:03]
why didn't you just leave?

[02:05]
Because I didn't think of that, and now I feel stupid.

[02:07]
Look, I have a right to be here.

[02:09]
No!

[02:10]
Maybe because you're skinny and maybe 'cause you're pretty,

[02:13]
you're used to getting away with things,

[02:15]
but I want you to know that your actions

[02:17]
have an effect on others, and I hate you,

[02:20]
and you are a horrible person,

[02:22]

Oh, funny story, I'm filming a reality show later,

Yeah, if it's 2003.

[05:28]
Ha ha. Don't tell VH1 that.

[05:30]
Seriously, though, please don't tell VH1 that.

We are calling it Peanutbutter and Jelly.

[05:35]
Get it?

[05:37]
- Because I'm Mr. Peanutbutter. - Okay, who's jelly?

No, no, no. It's like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

It's wordplay.

You may have too forgiving a definition

Right. You definitely should have already been gone.

Hey, excuse me.

[06:43]
Yes, I am BoJack Horseman, star of Horsin' Around.

[06:46]
Yeah, okay, I don't care.

[06:48]
Those are my muffins.

[06:49]
I'm sorry, I-- I don't understand.

[06:51]
Did you bring them into the store with you?

[06:53]
No, but I was going to buy them.

[06:56]
That's the last box, and I had dibs on them.

[06:58]
Really? You had dibs?

[07:01]
Yeah, dibs.

[07:02]
I just put them down for a second

[07:04]
while I went to the bathroom.

[07:05]
Look, I don't even want the muffins.

[07:07]
I was just looking at them, but I got to say,

[07:09]
if you put muffins down, they're not your muffins.

[07:11]
So what, I was supposed to take them

[07:13]
into the bathroom with me?

[07:14]
You didn't even put the muffins in a cart.

[07:16]
You just left them out here.

[07:17]
Yeah, in the produce section.

[07:19]
Clearly, muffins aren't supposed to be in the produce section.

[07:22]
That wasn't a sign to you that maybe someone else had dibs?

[07:24]
Look, I don't want to get into a whole thing here.

[07:26]
Then give me the muffins.

[07:28]
No, 'cause maybe now I want the muffins.

[07:32]
You think that because you're a pseudo-celebrity,

[07:33]
normal rules don't apply to you?

[07:35]
Pseudo? Would you say that to Eric McCormack?

[07:38]
Look, I've had a rough morning, so I don't need--

[07:40]
You've had a rough morning?

[07:42]
I spent the last ten months--

[07:45]
Hey!

[07:47]
Sorry, wasn't listening. See ya.

[07:49]
You're going to regret this, BoJack Horseman.

[07:53]
[laughing] Oh, really?

[07:54]
I'm gonna regret buying muffins?

[07:56]
What, have they got a lot of saturated fat in them?

[07:59]
Oh, man, they do have a lot of saturated fat.

[08:01]
Why'd I buy these?

[08:08]
Man, I really regret buying those muffins

[08:10]
and then eating them all on the drive home.

[08:13]
Well, my date with Ayako went really well.

[08:14]
Thanks for asking.

[08:15]
I specifically didn't ask,

[08:17]
and I'll thank you to respect

[08:18]
my total lack of interest in your personal life.

[08:20]
She's hilarious.

[08:22]
I never met a girl who was so curious

Still not interested.

What's your hurry?

[08:29]
What do you guys think I should get Ayako

[08:31]

[08:33]
She wants a framed picture of my mother's maiden name.

[08:36]
Okay, let's get to work.

[08:41]
Let's start at the beginning.

[08:43]
What was your childhood like?

[08:45]
- Normal. - Normal?

[08:47]
Yeah, it was, uh, normal-- normal childhood stuff.

[08:50]
Here's your omelet.

[08:52]
I'm sorry it's not as good

[08:54]
as the omelets your secretary makes,

[08:55]
but then you're not married to your secretary, are you?

[08:58]
Well, maybe if my secretary also refused to get an abortion,

[09:01]
I would be.

[09:02]
Mommy, can I have an omelet?

[09:04]
You're the birthday boy.

[09:07]
Normal childhood,

[09:09]
and then just get right into the big, famous part.

[09:12]
Look, if you're not ready to talk, we can wait.

[09:13]
I am ready to talk.

[09:15]
Why wouldn't I want to talk about my parents?

[09:17]
They're so normal. That's crazy.

[09:18]
You sound like a crazy person, not me.

[09:20]
Stop being so crazy, crazy.

[09:21]
[laughing] Why are you calling me crazy?

[09:23]
Okay. Was your father-- [upbeat ringtone]

Our guest via satellite is Neal McBeal,

[10:04]
a naval officer on leave from Afghanistan.

[10:07]
Welcome to the program, Neal.

[10:08]
Thank you, Tom.

[10:09]
Hey, I met this guy.

[10:11]
All Neal wanted when he got home--

[10:13]
and I emphasize, from Afghanistan--

[10:17]
was his favorite brand of breakfast muffins.

[10:21]
When he went to the supermarket and called dibs

[10:23]
on the last box--

[10:24]
Well, tell us what happened, Neal.

[10:26]
BoJack Horseman, from the '90s sitcom Horsin' Around,

[10:30]
refused to respect my dibs.

[10:32]
Have you no shame, BoJack Horseman?

[10:35]
Seen here sneezing at a Christmas party.

[10:37]
Oh, not the sneezing pic--

[10:38]
Why do they always use the sneezing picture?

[10:40]
In the '90s, we laughed at your antics.

[10:42]
Oh, how we laughed. "Ha ha ha,"

[10:45]
we chortled in rapturous glee.

[10:46]
But when you deny the dibs called by our men and women

[10:50]
on the frontlines, that is a sick joke, sir.

[10:52]
A sick, sick joke, indeed,

[10:55]
and you'll forgive me if I chortle no longer,

[10:57]
for, to me, there is nothing the least bit funny

[11:00]
about stealing a meal from Neal McBeal, the Navy SEAL.

[11:04]
[grunting]

[11:05]
Wait, wait, you stole muffins from a Navy SEAL?

[11:09]
I didn't know he was a Navy SEAL.

[11:10]
I just thought he was the regular kind of seal.

[11:12]
This is classic Hollywood elitism.

[11:14]
BoJack Horseman thinks that because he was on TV,

[11:16]
that makes him better than everybody.

[11:18]
Well, guess what, BoJack, now I'm on TV,

[11:20]
so now I'm better than everybody!

[11:22]
That's right, Neal.

[11:24]
You didn't even have dibs, you stupid sea cow.

[11:26]
You guys think I should call in and set the record straight?

[11:29]
BoJack, these people feed off controversy.

[11:31]
If you dignify the story with a response, it's just gonna fan--

[11:33]
I'm now receiving word

[11:35]
that we've got BoJack himself on the phone.

[11:38]
Sorry, stopped listening.

[11:39]
You were ramping up to a "yes," right?

[11:41]
BoJack, what you did today

[11:43]
was a slap in the face of America's heroes.

[11:45]
Will you apologize?

[11:48]
Okay, enough about America's heroes.

[11:51]
Can we talk about dibs?

[11:52]
Because he didn't even really have dibs.

[11:54]
If he had legitimate dibs--

[11:56]
Oh, I had dibs on the muffins.

[11:57]
I hid them in the produce section!

[12:00]
You left them totally out in the open.

[12:01]
That's hiding?

[12:03]
[yelling] How did you survive in Afghanistan?

[12:04]
Those are my muffins!

[12:05]
You give me back my muffins! [barks]

[12:07]
Hey, guess what, I can't give them back

[12:09]
'cause I ate them all, okay?

[12:10]
Dude.

[12:12]
Hold on, just to be clear, since this morning,

[12:14]
you ate all the muffins?

[12:16]
Yeah, I ate them all in one sitting

[12:18]
because I have no self-control and I hate myself.

[12:20]
Is that what you want to hear?

[12:22]
Neal, was it a small container of muffins,

[12:23]
like two to four muffins?

[12:25]
No, Tom, there were a good deal more than that.

[12:28]
Can you remember exactly how many muffins were in the box?

[12:30]
Yeah, there were exactly 12!

[12:32]
I ate 12 muffins, and I didn't even want one!

[12:36]
There's your goddamn news story,

[12:38]
the mystery of my missing goddamn self-respect!

[12:42]
[pants]

[12:46]
How'd I come off?

[12:47]
Well, that went slightly better than the worst

[12:51]
it could have possibly gone, so hooray?

[12:59]
It's not even about the muffins.

[13:01]
Everyone is just out to get me

[13:03]
because I'm famous and so well-adjusted.

[13:05]
Well, at least you've got some privacy.

[13:07]
My boyfriend's filming a reality show at our house.

[13:09]
If I want to be alone, I have to go to the roof

[13:11]
because it's the only place they don't have insurance to film.

[13:13]
You go on the roof?

[13:14]
Yeah, just to get some work done.

[13:16]
Is that really weird?

[13:18]
No, it's adorable.

[13:19]
When I was a kid, I used to climb onto the roof

[13:22]
with my dad and look at the stars.

[13:24]
What about you?

[13:25]
Were you close with your father?

[13:27]
Happy Father's Day, Daddy.

[13:29]
What is this supposed to be, a lima bean?

[13:31]
It's a heart.

[13:32]
That's some shoddy craftsmanship, son.

[13:35]
- I tried my best. - No, you didn't.

[13:37]
You slacked off and took the easy way out.

[13:39]
In this world, you can either

[13:40]
do things the easy way or the right way.

[13:42]
You take a boat from here to New York,

[13:43]
you gonna go around the horn like a gentleman

[13:45]
or cut through the Panama Canal like some kind of democrat?

[13:48]
Um, the canal?

[13:49]
You go around the horn the way God intended!

[13:53]
Uneventful.

[13:54]
- What? - What?

[13:56]
I asked if you were close with your father,

[13:58]
and you sat here in silence for five minutes

[14:00]
and then said, "Uneventful."

[14:02]
You know what, this is a really good conversation,

[14:05]
and I definitely want to keep having it,

[14:07]
but I just keep thinking about the muffins thing,

[14:09]
so maybe we could put a pin in this

[14:11]
thorough deconstruction of my past,

[14:12]
so I can put that other thing

[14:13]
to bed before it spirals out of con--

[14:15]
I had dibs!

[14:17]
- My dibs were on those muffins! - Your dibs were void!

[14:19]
I spent a year in Afghanistan making America safer,

[14:23]
and this is the thanks I get?

[14:25]
Really, you, specifically, made America safer?

[14:28]
Well, BoJack, surely, even you would agree

[14:31]
that the troops are heroes.

[14:32]
I don't agree to that.

[14:34]
Maybe some of the troops are heroes but not automatically.

[14:37]
I'm sure a lot of the troops are jerks.

[14:38]
Most people are jerks already,

[14:40]
and it's not like giving a jerk a gun and telling him

[14:42]
it's okay to kill people

[14:44]
suddenly turns that jerk into a hero.

[14:48]
What?

[14:50]
Did you just say you think the troops are jerks?

[14:54]
Oh, you took that the bad way, didn't you?

[14:59]
I'm sure a lot of the troops are jerks.

[15:01]
No, no, no.

[15:02]

[15:42]
you're right, and everyone else is wrong.

[15:43]
But if you don't swallow your pride,

[15:44]
this is never gonna let up.

[15:46]
- I know you're stubborn-- - I'm not stubborn.

[15:48]
- I'm proud. - That's kind of the same thing.

[15:49]
No, it's an important distinction.

[15:51]
Okay, fine. You're not stubborn.

[15:53]
But I'm about to tell you something very important,

[15:55]
so I want you to listen carefully.

[15:57]
I'm getting another call.

[16:00]
I'm gonna have to put you on hold.

It is now day three of the great BoJack jerk-off--

[16:11]
Really?

[16:12]
That's the name we came up with for this?

[16:14]
Who came up with that? Was it Randy?

[16:17]
Did Randy come up with that?

[16:20]
Anyway, the former television actor

[16:21]
who hates our troops has not left his home

[16:23]
since his controversial remarks on Monday

[16:25]
about how he hates the troops.

[16:27]
BoJack Horseman makes me sick.

[16:29]
He voiced his opinion, even though it was unpopular,

[16:31]
and that's the most cowardly thing a person can do.

[16:34]
After we made love, he covered himself in sheets like an Arab.

[16:38]
At this very moment,

[16:40]
Congress is voting on a major education bill

[16:42]
that could completely restructure the--

[16:44]
Joan, I'm sorry to interrupt you,

[16:46]
but we've got some big news on the BoJack Horseman front.

[16:48]
It appears that BoJack's Lexus is coming out of the garage.

[16:52]
This is very big news, indeed.

[16:54]
Any comment on BoJack's controversial remarks this week?

[16:56]
Uh, nope. [tires screech]

[17:01]
So where are we going?

[17:02]
Don't worry, I've got a plan.

[17:05]
[tires screech] Whoa!

[17:06]
Jeez.

[17:08]
Ayako, hey, I need you to get me three tickets to Kyoto.

[17:12]
[speaking Japanese] You son of a bitch!

[17:14]
You told me you were

[17:15]
an obscenely rich American entrepreneur.

[17:17]
You had eighty dollars in your bank account.

[17:21]
Eighty!

[17:22]
Hey, I meant I was rich

[17:23]
because I have friends like George Bailey.

[17:26]
[speaking Japanese] Who the shit is George Bailey?

[17:28]
Do you have any idea how much work went into scamming you?

[17:31]
George Bailey!

[17:32]
Hello?

[17:34]
Well, I'm out of ideas.

[17:36]
We can hide out at my place while we make a plan.

[17:42]
Yeah, great, just get me away from the cameras.

[17:46]
Do we really need to be filming this?

[17:48]
It's for my reality show.

[17:50]
You never know when gold's gonna strike.

[17:52]
Yeah, gold doesn't strike.

[17:53]
That's why you never know.

[17:55]
BoJack, be nice.

[17:57]
Just pretend they're not there.

[17:59]
Okay. Well, I--

[18:00]
Could you speak up, please?

[18:02]
- I'd like to-- - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

[18:04]
That's too loud.

[18:06]
I want to fix this as quickly as possible.

[18:08]
I don't care who was right about the muffins anymore,

[18:10]
even though I was definitely right.

[18:11]
I just want my privacy back, so I can finish writing

[18:14]
my tell-all memoir, so everyone will pay attention to me again.

[18:17]
I've already reached out to the McBeal camp.

[18:19]
He's willing to publicly forgive you if you publicly apologize

[18:22]
and present to him a box of muffins as a symbol

[18:25]
of your great admiration for the American military

[18:27]
and everything they do.

[18:28]
But I ate the muffins.

[18:30]
I know. We got another box.

[18:31]
It's in the cupboard.

[18:32]
Oh, you were saving those? I ate those too.

[18:34]
We've been here for ten minutes!

[18:36]
It's okay, we'll get more muffins.

[18:38]
I'll get the muffins, and they're on me.

[18:40]
I just found out I got 80 bucks in the bank.

[18:43]
I'm helping! Hooray!

[18:46]
So where are we gonna do this?

[18:47]
Do I have to go on MSNBSea?

[18:49]
No, we should do it somewhere people will actually see it.

[18:51]
Oh, why don't you do it on Peanutbutter and Jelly?

[18:54]
You can't call a show Peanutbutter and Jelly

[18:57]
if there's no jelly.

[18:58]
It's a pun.

[19:00]
It's not a pun if it only works one way.

[19:02]
Is this a necessary conversation

[19:03]
to be having right now?

[19:05]
Look, I know tempers are high,

[19:07]
but let's not take it out on the great title

[19:09]
for my reality show,

[19:10]
which we all agree is really clever.

We can edit this to make me look smart, right?

How's this look? Looks good?

[19:20]
- Okay. - Marker, sound, speed.

[19:23]
Well, here I am, hanging out

[19:25]
with my good friend BoJack Horseman,

[19:27]
enjoying each other's company,

[19:29]
as we often do.

[19:31]
Yes, this is all very authentic and natural.

[19:33]
[doorbell rings]

[19:34]
Oh, someone's at the door!

[19:36]
I will see who it is.

[19:41]
Wow, this is a surprise.

[19:43]
Neal McBeal.

[19:44]
Hello, sir.

[19:46]
Thank you for inviting me into your home. It is lovely.

[19:49]
BoJack, is there anything you'd like to give Neal McBeal?

[19:54]
Ahem.

[19:55]
Oh, yeah, Todd?

[19:57]
What the hell is this?

[19:59]
I tried to buy the muffins,

[20:00]
but my bank card got declined for some reason.

[20:03]
But don't worry, I still saved the day

[20:05]
because I found this bag of stale hamburger buns.

[20:08]
I'm sorry?

[20:10]
Yeah, they're just giving them away behind In-N-Out.

[20:12]
Why does anybody pay for anything?

[20:15]
Ow.

[20:16]
Uh, Neal, as a token of my admiration,

[20:19]
please accept this bag of stale hamburger buns.

[20:24]
- What? - Yes, hamburger buns.

[20:26]
It's a symbol for how we throw our veterans

[20:30]
in the trash, sadly, far too often.

[20:32]
I'm listening.

[20:34]
We send our muffins overseas,

[20:36]
and they come back as stale hamburger buns,

[20:39]
but that doesn't mean we should love them any less,

[20:42]
because in their own way,

[20:43]
aren't stale hamburger buns just as good?

[20:47]
Mmm.

[20:49]
American made.

[20:51]
So what you're saying is,

[20:55]
you think I'm a hero.

[20:57]
Well, I don't know if I--

[20:59]
Say it, BoJack. Say I'm a hero.

[21:04]
You're a hero.

[21:05]
The troops are all heroes, every single one.

[21:09]
Great.

[21:10]
And I don't believe saying that cheapens the word

[21:13]
and actually disrespects those we mean to honor

[21:15]
by turning real people into political pawns.

[21:19]
Okay, you can let go of the bag now.

[21:22]
Also, I am not deeply ambivalent

[21:24]
about a seemingly mandated celebration of our military

[21:27]
by a nation that claims to value peace

[21:29]
telling our children that violence is never the answer

[21:31]
while refusing to hold our own government to the same standard.

[21:35]
Yeah, me neither. I think we're in agreement here.

[21:37]
Furthermore, I do not find it unbelievably appropriate

[21:40]
that this conversation is taking place on reality television,

[21:44]
a genre which thrives on

[21:45]
chopping the complexities of our era

[21:47]
into easily digestible chunks of empty catchphrases.

[21:51]
Okay.

[21:53]
And finally, I don't--

[21:55]
Hey, look, Mr. Peanutbutter got a bucket stuck on his head.

[21:58]
Guys, guys, where am I? Can someone tell me where I am?

[22:02]
Hey, where'd he get that bucket from?

[22:04]
Who gave him a bucket?

[22:06]
[laughter]

[22:08]
Uh, actually, I had another point I wanted to make.

[22:11]
Yeah, but who doesn't love a dog with a bucket on his head?

[22:14]
Come on.

[22:15]
Bucket! Bucket!

[22:17]
[crowd] Bucket!

[22:18]
Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Bucket!

[22:22]
Hey, can anyone find a handle?

[22:25]
[howls] [all cheer]

[22:27]
Oh, thank you, my friend.

[22:29]
You're a real hero.

[22:31]
Unbelievable.

[22:33]
What's your name, young lady?

[22:34]
Well, my real name's Angela,

[22:36]
but my friends call me Jelly.

[22:37]
What? Oh, my God, did we get that?

[22:40]
Please tell me we got that.

[22:49]
[chuffs]

[22:50]
You want a day-old hamburger bun?

[22:52]
I'm all right. How'd it go down there?

[22:54]
You know what the problem is with everybody?

[22:57]
They all just want to hear what they already believe.

[22:59]
No one ever wants to hear the truth.

[23:01]
I want to hear the truth.

[23:03]
I don't know if you want to tell it, though.

[23:04]
What do you mean?

[23:06]
Mr. Normal Childhood, Mr. Uneventful Father?

[23:10]
Look, I can write you the standard

[23:11]
empty-calorie celebrity tell-some,

[23:13]
if that's what you're looking for,

[23:15]
but I thought you might want more than that.

[23:16]
I do.

[23:18]
Well, then you're going to have to open up

[23:19]
and give me something real.

[23:21]
What, you think I can't open up?

[23:22]
Well, I don't know if you can or not.

[23:23]
You certainly haven't.

[23:25]
[sighs]

[23:27]
Okay, from now on, full truth, warts and all.

[23:31]
You're not gonna make me look like an asshole, are you?

[23:34]
I don't know, are you an asshole?

[23:38]
Okay, full truth, here we go.

[23:41]
You want to know about my parents?

[23:43]
They drank a lot.

[23:45]
My father was a failed novelist.

[23:46]
My mother was the heiress to the Sugarman sugar cubes fortune,

[23:49]
and my dad resented her for it.

[23:51]
He used to make me cry with him

[23:53]
while listening to Cole Porter records.

[23:54]
He made me build my own tree house,

[23:56]
and then he tore it down while I was at summer camp

[23:58]
because instead of hearty, Christian nails,

[24:00]
I used screws, which he called fancy Jew nails.

[24:04]
Like I said, totally normal.
