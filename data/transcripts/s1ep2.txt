[06:58]
BOJACK: Really? You had dibs?

[07:01]
NEAL MCBEAL: Yeah, dibs. I just put them down for a second while I went to the bathroom.

[07:14]
BOJACK: You didn't even put the muffins in a cart. You just left them out here.

BOJACK: Hey, I met this guy.

[10:11]
TOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: All Neal wanted when he got home-- and I emphasize, from Afghanistan-- was his favorite brand of breakfast muffins. When he went to the supermarket and called dibs on the last box-- Well, tell us what happened, Neal.

[10:26]
NEAL MCBEAL: BoJack Horseman, from the '90s sitcom Horsin' Around, refused to respect my dibs.

[10:32]
TOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: Have you no shame, BoJack Horseman? Seen here sneezing at a Christmas party.

[10:37]
BOJACK: Oh, not the sneezing pic-- Why do they always use the sneezing picture?

[10:40]
TOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: In the '90s, we laughed at your antics. Oh, how we laughed. "Ha ha ha," we chortled in rapturous glee. But when you deny the dibs called by our men and women on the frontlines, that is a sick joke, sir. A sick, sick joke, indeed, and you'll forgive me if I chortle no longer, for, to me, there is nothing the least bit funny about stealing a meal from Neal McBeal, the Navy SEAL. [grunting]

[11:05]

BOJACK: I didn't know he was a Navy SEAL. I just thought he was the regular kind of seal.

TOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: That's right, Neal.

BOJACK: You didn't even have dibs, you stupid sea cow. You guys think I should call in and set the record straight?

[11:41]
TOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: BoJack, what you did today was a slap in the face of America's heroes. Will you apologize?

[11:48]
BOJACK: Okay, enough about America's heroes. Can we talk about dibs? Because he didn't even really have dibs. If he had legitimate dibs--

[11:56]
NEAL MCBEAL: Oh, I had dibs on the muffins. I hid them in the produce section!

[12:00]
BOJACK: You left them totally out in the open. That's hiding? [yelling] How did you survive in Afghanistan?

[12:04]
NEAL MCBEAL: Those are my muffins! You give me back my muffins! [barks]

TODD: Dude.

TOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: Hold on, just to be clear, since this morning, you ate all the muffins?

[12:22]
TOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: Neal, was it a small container of muffins, like two to four muffins?

[12:25]
NEAL MCBEAL: No, Tom, there were a good deal more than that.

[12:28]
TOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: Can you remember exactly how many muffins were in the box?

[12:30]
BOJACK: Yeah, there were exactly 12! I ate 12 muffins, and I didn't even want one! There's your goddamn news story, the mystery of my missing goddamn self-respect! [pants] How'd I come off?

TOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: Well, BoJack, surely, even you would agree that the troops are heroes.

[14:32]
BOJACK: I don't agree to that. Maybe some of the troops are heroes but not automatically. I'm sure a lot of the troops are jerks. Most people are jerks already, and it's not like giving a jerk a gun and telling him it's okay to kill people suddenly turns that jerk into a hero. What?

CAROLYN: We've been here for ten minutes! It's okay, we'll get more muffins.

[18:38]
TODD: I'll get the muffins, and they're on me. I just found out I got 80 bucks in the bank. I'm helping! Hooray!

[18:46]
BOJACK: So where are we gonna do this? Do I have to go on MSNBSea?

[18:49]
CAROLYN: No, we should do it somewhere people will actually see it.

[18:51]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, why don't you do it on Peanutbutter and Jelly?

[18:54]
BOJACK: You can't call a show Peanutbutter and Jelly if there's no jelly.

[18:58]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: It's a pun.

[19:00]
BOJACK: It's not a pun if it only works one way.

[19:02]
CAROLYN: Is this a necessary conversation to be having right now?

[19:05]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Look, I know tempers are high, but let's not take it out on the great title for my reality show, which we all agree is really clever. We can edit this to make me look smart, right?

[19:18]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: How's this look? Looks good? Okay.

[19:21]
CREW MEMBER: Marker, sound, speed.

[19:23]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well, here I am, hanging out with my good friend BoJack Horseman, enjoying each other's company, as we often do.

[19:31]
BOJACK: Yes, this is all very authentic and natural.

[19:33]
[doorbell rings]

[19:34]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, someone's at the door! I will see who it is. Wow, this is a surprise. Neal McBeal.

[19:44]
NEAL MCBEAL: Hello, sir. Thank you for inviting me into your home. It is lovely.

[19:49]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: BoJack, is there anything you'd like to give Neal McBeal?

[19:54]
NEAL MCBEAL: Ahem.

[19:55]
BOJACK: Oh, yeah, Todd? What the hell is this?

[19:59]
TODD: I tried to buy the muffins, but my bank card got declined for some reason. But don't worry, I still saved the day because I found this bag of stale hamburger buns.

[20:08]
BOJACK: I'm sorry?

[20:10]
TODD: Yeah, they're just giving them away behind In-N-Out. Why does anybody pay for anything? Ow.

[20:16]
BOJACK: Uh, Neal, as a token of my admiration, please accept this bag of stale hamburger buns.

[20:24]
NEAL MCBEAL: What?

[20:25]
BOJACK: Yes, hamburger buns. It's a symbol for how we throw our veterans in the trash, sadly, far too often.

[20:32]
NEAL MCBEAL: I'm listening.

[20:34]
BOJACK: We send our muffins overseas, and they come back as stale hamburger buns, but that doesn't mean we should love them any less, because in their own way, aren't stale hamburger buns just as good? Mmm. American made.

[20:51]
NEAL MCBEAL: So what you're saying is, you think I'm a hero.

[20:57]
BOJACK: Well, I don't know if I--

[20:59]
NEAL MCBEAL: Say it, BoJack. Say I'm a hero.

[21:04]
BOJACK: You're a hero. The troops are all heroes, every single one.

[21:09]
NEAL MCBEAL: Great.

[21:10]
BOJACK: And I don't believe saying that cheapens the word and actually disrespects those we mean to honor by turning real people into political pawns.

[21:19]
NEAL MCBEAL: Okay, you can let go of the bag now.

[21:22]
BOJACK: Also, I am not deeply ambivalent about a seemingly mandated celebration of our military by a nation that claims to value peace telling our children that violence is never the answer while refusing to hold our own government to the same standard.

[21:35]
NEAL MCBEAL: Yeah, me neither. I think we're in agreement here.

[21:37]
BOJACK: Furthermore, I do not find it unbelievably appropriate that this conversation is taking place on reality television, a genre which thrives on chopping the complexities of our era into easily digestible chunks of empty catchphrases.

[21:51]
NEAL MCBEAL: Okay.

[21:53]
BOJACK: And finally, I don't--

[21:55]
CREW MEMBER: Hey, look, Mr. Peanutbutter got a bucket stuck on his head.

[21:58]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Guys, guys, where am I? Can someone tell me where I am?

[22:02]
NEAL MCBEAL: Hey, where'd he get that bucket from? Who gave him a bucket? [laughter]

[22:08]
BOJACK: Uh, actually, I had another point I wanted to make.

[22:11]
TODD: Yeah, but who doesn't love a dog with a bucket on his head? Come on. Bucket! Bucket!

[22:17]
CROWD: Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Bucket!

[22:22]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey, can anyone find a handle? [howls]

[22:25]
[all cheer]

[22:27]
MR PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, thank you, my friend. You're a real hero.

[22:31]
BOJACK: Unbelievable.

[22:33]
MR PEANUTBUTTER: What's your name, young lady?

[22:34]
JELLY: Well, my real name's Angela, but my friends call me Jelly.

[22:37]
MR PEANUTBUTTER: What? Oh, my God, did we get that? Please tell me we got that.

[22:49]
BOJACK: [chuffs] You want a day-old hamburger bun?

[22:52]
DIANE: I'm all right. How'd it go down there?

[22:54]
BOJACK: You know what the problem is with everybody? They all just want to hear what they already believe. No one ever wants to hear the truth.

[23:01]
DIANE: I want to hear the truth. I don't know if you want to tell it, though.

[23:04]
BOJACK: What do you mean?

[23:06]
DIANE: Mr. Normal Childhood, Mr. Uneventful Father? Look, I can write you the standard empty-calorie celebrity tell-some, if that's what you're looking for, but I thought you might want more than that.

[23:16]
BOJACK: I do.

[23:18]
DIANE: Well, then you're going to have to open up and give me something real.

[23:21]
BOJACK: What, you think I can't open up?

[23:22]
DIANE: Well, I don't know if you can or not. You certainly haven't.

[23:25]
BOJACK: [sighs] Okay, from now on, full truth, warts and all. You're not gonna make me look like an asshole, are you?

[23:34]
DIANE: I don't know, are you an asshole?

[23:38]
BOJACK: Okay, full truth, here we go. You want to know about my parents? They drank a lot. My father was a failed novelist. My mother was the heiress to the Sugarman sugar cubes fortune, and my dad resented her for it. He used to make me cry with him while listening to Cole Porter records. He made me build my own tree house, and then he tore it down while I was at summer camp because instead of hearty, Christian nails, I used screws, which he called fancy Jew nails. Like I said, totally normal.
