[00:10]
As your accountant, I felt it necessary to do this in person.

[00:14]
Us, too. Because we're really accounting on you...

[00:16]
-No. -to get in on the ground floor of this...

[00:19]
No, don't do this. Please, God, no.

[00:20]
...PB Livin' product.

[00:21]
Has this ever happened to you?

[00:24]
Whatever it is, it hasn't happened. Nothing has ever happened to me.

[00:27]
-You say you love a toasted bagel. -I would never say that.

[00:30]
-I have celiac disease. -Ding. Bagel's ready.

[00:34]
-But wait. -Son of a--

[00:35]
-Hey. That bagel was too fast. -No.

[00:38]
That's why PB Livin' presents, the Bagel Catcher.

[00:41]
-For all those hard-to-catch bagels. -No, no. Stop. Enough. Enough.

[00:44]
Stop talking! I can't take it anymore!

[00:47]
PB Livin' is filing for bankruptcy.

[00:49]
-I'm shutting you down. -I thought you were a customer.

[00:52]
I don't get what's happening.

[00:53]
What's happening is you two knuckleheads threw thousands of dollars

[00:57]
into a bunch of dumb ideas.

[00:58]
You paid 50 grand to a bunch of kindergartners

[01:02]
for the movie rights to the game "tag."

[01:05]
Our business manager was over the moon for that.

[01:07]
Business manager? Who the hell is your business manager?

[01:10]
Business-wise, this all seems like appropriate business.

[01:14]
You two are done.

[01:16]
This company is more in the red than Carrie on prom night.

[01:20]
So, what you're saying is, we're just one great idea away from breaking even?

[01:25]
No. You're-- [grunts] You are out of money.

[01:28]
Mr. Peanutbutter, you need to get a job.

[01:31]
-Are you hiring at your accounting firm? -Dude, no.

[01:39]
I'm waiting for my agent. He'll be with me any moment.

[01:42]
Mr. Peanutbutter is going back to work.

[01:45]
Yeah. He's probably just organizing all the amazing opportunities.

[01:49]
I haven't heard from him in years, so they've probably been piling up.

[01:53]
Maybe I should just go check on him.

[01:55]
[knocking on door]

[01:56]
Hello, Ronnie? It's your favorite client, Mr. Peanutbutter.

[02:00]
Well, I'm coming in. I hope you're-- Oh! Oh, my God.

[02:03]
Ronnie, how'd you get that belt around your neck,

[02:05]
then caught on the filing cabinet, which made your pants fall down

[02:07]
while you were researching pornograph-- Oh, I see what happened here.

[02:13]
[♪♪]

[03:07]
[upbeat theme music playing]

[03:08]
[in unison] Morning time, Hollywoo.

[03:10]
-I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type. -And I'm Some Lady.

[03:13]
Here's a thing written on a card.

[03:15]
Last night, major Hollywoo agent Ronnie Bonito was found dead in his office...

[03:19]
Ruh-roh.

[03:20]
...in what authorities are calling a mishap of a sexual nature.

[03:24]
-What does that mean? -You know, auto-erotic asphyxiation.

[03:28]
Auto-a-what's it who's it?

[03:30]
Oh, is that that thing where you strangle yourself

[03:33]
in an attempt to heighten sexual arousal?

[03:36]
It sure is.

[03:38]
[hosts laughing on TV]

[03:40]
Coming up, a food truck that serves just one thing: gravy.

[03:43]
Did you hear that? New food truck.

[03:45]
-We should go. -I'm in.

[03:47]
Hey, can I get some lunch money? It's pizza day today.

[03:49]
Sure thing, sport. Wait, where is it pizza day?

[03:51]
-In my tummy. -Oh...

[03:53]
Hey, BoJack, would you zip me up? My shoulder is killing me.

[03:56]
I'm not sleeping right. We need to do something about that bed.

[03:59]
Just because I'm nocturnal doesn't mean I wanna be up all night.

[04:02]
-I propped it up with a Golden Globe. -It still wobbles.

[04:05]
-Yeah. Anyway, I got you something. -Oh.

[04:07]
A beeper? BoJack, it's great, but you know, I already have one.

[04:10]
Yeah, you have a beeper, but I don't.

[04:12]
Now, you can page me whenever you want.

[04:15]
Huh. BoJack, I love it, and you're gonna love it, too.

[04:19]
There's all kinds of codes we can send each other.

[04:21]
"Zero, zero, zero" is "call me,"

[04:23]
and "1-2-3" is "I miss you" and "8-0-0-8-5" is boobs.

[04:27]
What? Boobs? Oh, my God.

[04:29]
What scamp came up with that one?

[04:31]
Okay, I gotta go. Dinner tonight?

[04:33]
Totally. Let's hit that gravy truck.

[04:36]
Okay, love you.

[04:38]
Uh...

[04:39]
Uh...

[04:42]
No, I don't.

[04:45]
Aw... "I love you. No, I don't"?

[04:49]
Uh... Keys.

[04:52]
Uh-oh.

[04:53]
[grunting]

[04:58]
[girl cries]

[04:59]
Get out.

[05:02]
[BoJack yells]

[05:05]
[tires screeching]

[05:06]
[cars crash]

[05:12]
Hold it. Hold the elevator.

[05:15]
Ooh. Ah. Ee. Ow.

[05:18]
Goddam it. No. No. Ow.

[05:20]
Oh. Ow. Oh...

[05:22]
Coffee? Hup.

[05:25]
Rutabaga, this day already sucks.

[05:27]
My heel broke while I was at this new food truck,

[05:30]
and I spilled a handful of gravy all over myself

[05:32]
because they don't sell bowls, just gravy.

[05:35]
Should've gone to the bowl truck first. That's where they get you.

[05:38]
Well, I guess the upside to being invisible around here

[05:41]
is that none of these assholes will ever notice what a mess I am.

[05:44]
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I see what a mess you are.

[05:47]
[chuckles] Aw...

[05:48]
Do you need the movie-star speech?

[05:50]
No, no, I'll be okay. And how are you?

[05:54]
Gotta look at paint for the new kitchen.

[05:56]
I have to pick a shade that won't clash with the splatter of blood

[05:58]
from when I blow my brains out after talking to Katie

[06:01]
about paint swatches all day. [laughs]

[06:04]
We do have fun.

[06:10]
So, what's the plan for today? Find a new agent, go on auditions?

[06:13]
No, I'm gonna do exactly what landed me Mr. Peanutbutter's House, oh, so long ago.

[06:18]
Wander around L.A. with an open mind

[06:20]
and an empty stomach until I get discovered.

[06:22]
But also, like, find a new agent and go on auditions, right?

[06:25]
Or should I start stealing food from work?

[06:27]
I'm just gonna go with the flow and leave everything up to destiny.

[06:31]
-Que sera quesadilla. -You know we could lose the house, right?

[06:34]
-[laughs] Diane. -Right?

[06:36]
Diane, Diane, Diane.

[06:38]
[door opens then closes]

[06:48]
-Diane. -Aah!

[06:49]
I wasn't stealing paper towels to use as dinner napkins. Why?

[06:52]
Here's a funny question for you:

[06:54]
If Mr. Peanutbutter said, "I love you. No, I don't,"

[06:56]
would you need to talk about that later and figure out what he meant?

[07:00]
Probably not, right? Because they're meaningless words?

[07:03]
I mean, language evolves, right?

[07:04]
How can anyone know what anything means?

[07:06]
The answer is nobody can. Nothing means anything.

[07:08]
So why bother talking about anything?

[07:10]
In this scenario, are Mr. Peanutbutter and I living in our house?

[07:13]
Or are we squatting in an abandoned Barnes &amp; Noble burning books to keep warm

[07:17]
as we struggle through our Dickensian-style poverty?

[07:20]
Uh...

[07:20]
[beeper plays ringtone]

[07:22]
"Zero, zero, zero." No idea what that means.

[07:24]
I think it means "call me."

[07:26]
Ignore. Wait, where's the ignore button?

[07:28]
How do I ignore?

[07:30]
I think with a beeper, you just ignore it.

[07:32]
-With what, my mind? -You seem a little stressed out.

[07:35]
That's because as soon as I'm done with work,

[07:37]
I have to have a long, awkward conversation

[07:40]
with Wanda about our relationship, unless... I'm never done with work.

[07:44]
Diane, you magnificent bastard. That's it.

[07:53]
I'll be out there in the stands.

[07:55]
And I'll be rooting for you, Secretariat.

[07:57]
Mm. Yeah.

[08:02]
[groans]

[08:04]
Your line is, "And I'll see you at the finish line."

[08:07]
Yeah, I know. I'm acting. Great. Now I gotta start all over.

[08:11]
Settle in, folks. We could be here a while.

[08:13]
[groans]

[08:17]
-Ow! Ooh. -Ah, Princess Carolyn.

[08:19]
So good of you to join us eventually.

[08:21]
Sorry I'm late. I had the worst morning.

[08:24]
You know who had an even "the worst-er" morning?

[08:26]
-Ronnie Bonito. Because he's dead. -He is?

[08:29]
He decided to strangle the dirty dangle

[08:32]
and now that sweet chariot has come for to carry him home.

[08:35]
Everyone who was here on time is taking a moment.

[08:40]
-Of silence? -Yes.

[08:42]
Also to reach out to his former clients.

[08:45]
-To offer their condolences? -Yes.

[08:47]
Also to recruit them to the Vigor roster.

[08:50]
-A Vigor agent is a vigorous agent. -Who do you want me to call?

[08:54]
I have ins with a bunch of Bonito's clients including all the major J's:

[08:58]
-Law, Lo, Leno, and J. Abrams. -Oh, that's wonderful news

[09:02]
in the parallel universe in which you were on time today.

[09:05]
In this reality, however, we're all good.

[09:08]
You can lap up the leftovers though.

[09:10]
-"Mr. Peanutbutter"? -Oh, and Princess Carolyn?

[09:13]
Get your shoe fixed.

[09:15]
You look like a woman from an '80s deodorant commercial.

[09:22]
[inhales sharply]

[09:24]
Here I go. Destiny, don't fail me now. [grunts]

[09:30]
Yeah. Hitting the pavement.

[09:32]
This is how it happens for a guy like me.

[09:41]
[grunts] Ew...

[09:44]
Out of my way, flyer.

[09:46]
Ugh. Flyer. Why do you have to be on my shoe in front of this store?

[09:51]
Wait, a second. Shoe.

[09:53]
Store.

[09:55]
Shoe store? Shoe store.

[09:58]
"Team players wanted"?

[09:59]
Oh, I'm such a good team player,

[10:01]
I make all the other team players look like garbage.

[10:04]
Lady Footlocker, meet your lord.

[10:13]
Finish... [grunts]

[10:17]
line.

[10:19]
Great, we got it. We got one take.

[10:22]
And now we gotta stop for the day.

[10:24]
What? No. Why stop now?

[10:25]
-I'm just getting warmed up. -Union rules. We're done. Go home.

[10:29]
Go home?

[10:30]
Why go home when we could extend this long day's journey into night?

[10:34]
-Drinks on me, folks. -I could use a drink.

[10:37]
-Or six. -Great, Corduroy's driving. Let's go.

[10:42]
[Corduroy] Ah...

[10:43]
-I really needed this, BoJack. -Me, too.

[10:45]
Yeah, man. This day's been really hard on me.

[10:47]
Ever since I heard about that agent who died from that blue-face blastoff?

[10:51]
-Blue-face blastoff? -The strokey chokey?

[10:53]
-The two-neck squeeze? -What?

[10:54]
You know, the one hand on the Adam's apple,

[10:56]
the other one's on the Adam's banana?

[10:59]
Oh, right. Right. Yeah. The auto-erotic--

[11:02]
That could've been me. I used to really be into that stuff.

[11:05]
I was a hardcore gasper.

[11:06]
Can't believe you have so many names for it.

[11:08]
Now I can't stop thinking about it.

[11:10]
I shouldn't even be alive right now.

[11:12]
Don't need to talk about how you masturbate.

[11:14]
-The orgasms you get-- -Okay, I guess we do.

[11:16]
It's like seeing a rainbow, but with all the colors.

[11:19]
-So, like a normal rainbow? -But it's too dangerous, man.

[11:22]
They say if you bite down on a lemon right at the point of climax,

[11:25]
the lemon juice gives you the jolt you need to not pass out and die.

[11:28]
But still man, you're just... rolling the dice.

[11:33]
Okay, this is getting really graphic.

[11:35]
Can we maybe talk about anything else?

[11:37]
-Sure. -Thank God.

[11:38]
Hey, man, it's funny you should mention God, because my new thing is... the Bible.

[11:43]
Uh...

[11:44]
Tell me, have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and personal savior?

[11:48]
So, noose-wise, what are we talking? You use a standard sailor's knot

[11:52]
or more like your average birthday-present bow?

[11:59]
[grunting softly]

[12:02]
[sighs]

[12:03]
-I beeped you, BoJack. -Oh, hey. About this morning--

[12:06]
-It's fine. -Because when I said that--

[12:08]
I said it's fine. You don't love me.

[12:10]
That's okay. I don't love you.

[12:13]
-What? -Good night.

[12:16]
[upbeat theme music playing]

[12:18]
[in unison] Morning time, Hollywoo.

[12:20]
-I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type. -And I'm Some Lady.

[12:23]
On today's show, I sit down with Hank Hippopopalous

[12:26]
to discuss his new smash hit, Hey, I Think You Can Dance.

[12:29]
Can you talk about your process?

[12:31]
When I see someone, and I think they can dance,

[12:34]
I say, "Hey, I think you can dance."

[12:37]
And when I think they can't dance, I say, "No, I don't think you can dance."

[12:41]
-And that is pretty much it. -Fascinating.

[12:45]
-So, last night when-- -BoJack, it's not a big deal.

[12:48]
You don't love me, I don't love you.

[12:50]
We're having a good time. It's fine.

[12:52]
Can't just say, "I don't love you" to someone.

[12:54]
-You said it to me. -Yeah, but that was different.

[12:57]
-How was that different? -Because you do love me. Right?

[12:59]
-Like a little bit? -No.

[13:01]
Uh, for what it's worth, I love both you guys.

[13:04]
Shut up, Todd. Grown-ups are talking.

[13:10]
Here you go, ma'am.

[13:13]
[women laughing and chattering]

[13:15]
Jessica Atkinson, come on down.

[13:19]
Mr. Peanutbutter?

[13:21]
Would you like to see what's in box number one or box number two?

[13:25]
Either way, it's a brand-new pair of shoes!

[13:29]
[women clapping and laughing]

[13:33]
Oh.

[13:35]
Hup. Carolyn.

[13:37]
-Rutabaga-- -Coffee?

[13:38]
I was thinking about you last night

[13:40]
while Katie and I were locked in a fascinating debate about counter granite.

[13:44]
And what if I told you I used to work Ronnie Bonito's desk,

[13:48]
and I happen to know that he had a client so hush-hush,

[13:51]
-it wasn't even on the master list. -What? Who? Tell me. Whoa!

[13:55]
[alarm ringing]

[13:56]
Beloved novelist J.D. Salinger. What?

[14:00]
The author of Catcher in the Rye?

[14:03]
-And... others? -Yuh-huh.

[14:05]
-Isn't he dead? -He's "reclusive."

[14:08]
Dude wanted to be left alone so much, he faked his own death.

[14:12]
Oh, my God.

[14:13]
Why are you giving this lead to me?

[14:15]
-Because I like you, dummy. -Huh.

[14:18]
Now we gotta wait for the fire department to come let us out of this elevator.

[14:26]
-Hey. -Corduroy, what are you doing here?

[14:28]
I need a favor. Can you hold on to this for me?

[14:30]
-Ew. Is this your Bible? -No, no, no.

[14:33]
-It's my choking-off kit. -Your kit?

[14:35]
Yeah. It has all my supplies.

[14:36]
Silk ties, a leather gag, velvet sock. Lemon.

[14:39]
You gotta take this off my hands. I can't trust myself with this.

[14:42]
I don't know if I want your jack-off kit at my house.

[14:44]
Please. I got this girlfriend. She loves me.

[14:47]
If I fall back into the old gasp-and-goo, it'll break her heart.

[14:50]
Wait. So, you're saying if someone loves you,

[14:53]
they don't want you to choke yourself while masturbating?

[14:55]
Yeah. It's really dangerous.

[14:57]
-All right. I'll take it. -Thanks, BoJack.

[15:00]
I still don't understand why you need a kit.

[15:02]
Can't you just use, like, a belt or a rope?

[15:04]
Oh, I guess.

[15:06]
I mean, I guess you could use anything.

[15:08]
I mean, you could use an iPhone charger, a shoelace, a necktie, a jump-rope...

[15:18]
[Carolyn] Hm...

[15:22]
Oh. Ooh.

[15:25]
-Oh, hello. I'm looking for some-- -Sorry, no looking allowed.

[15:28]
This store is for customers only.

[15:30]
Okay, then, I would like to buy a bicycle. What would you recommend?

[15:34]
-One with a bell, or--? -You got me.

[15:36]
I don't know anything about bicycles. I'm J.D. Salinger. I faked my own death.

[15:40]
Mr. Salinger. Such a pleasure. Princess Carolyn, big fan.

[15:45]
Let me guess, Catcher in the Rye?

[15:47]
And others.

[15:49]
-I wanna say The Hobbi-- -Nope.

[15:51]
Look. I'm an agent.

[15:53]
It doesn't matter whether I've read your work.

[15:55]
What matters is I can look you in the eye and tell you I'm a big fan.

[15:59]
The world is ready for your comeback, and I wanna help.

[16:02]
No, thank you. Not interested.

[16:04]
Did that before, didn't work out well.

[16:06]
Fans were relentless. The critics were cruel.

[16:08]
And that's why my motto is, "It's better to be alone."

[16:11]
Which, come to think of it,

[16:13]
is probably why I don't sell a lot of tandem bicycles.

[16:16]
But, J.D. Salinger, you are J.D. Salinger.

[16:18]
You are a goddamn American treasure.

[16:21]
But every time I go out in the world, people hound me about my books.

[16:24]
Well, book.

[16:26]
What if I told you there was a place where no one reads books?

[16:29]
I'm listening.

[16:30]
A place where people only read headlines, lists and pictures.

[16:33]
A place where people hate reading so much,

[16:36]
they hire others to do it for them and don't even pay a living wage.

[16:39]
What do you mean, like, modern reading slaves?

[16:42]
Exactly.

[16:44]
And all those modern reading slaves really wanna be doing

[16:46]
is writing things that, one day, other people will also avoid reading.

[16:50]
-Does such a place truly exist? -Come with me, J.D. Salinger.

[16:54]
Let's go to Hollywoo.

[17:02]
Hup!

[17:04]
Oh... [sighs]

[17:07]
-Hey. -Hey.

[17:09]
-We need to talk. -Okay.

[17:11]
You're probably wondering what this beautiful mahogany box is.

[17:14]
-I wasn't wondering that. -It's my auto-erotic asphyxiation kit.

[17:17]
I've decided to do the funky Spider-Man.

[17:20]
-What? Funky Spider-Man? -I came up with that one myself.

[17:22]
Because he hangs, then he shoots webbing.

[17:24]
Wait. Are you saying you want to auto-erotic asphyxiate yourself?

[17:28]
Yes. I do.

[17:29]
Even though it's very dangerous

[17:31]
-and I could die. -Oh.

[17:33]
Now, if you love me, you probably wouldn't want me to do it.

[17:36]
-Okay. I get it. -Since you don't, I should do it, right?

[17:39]
I mean, there's no reason not to... unless you love me.

[17:42]
-Do it. -Wait. Seriously?

[17:44]
Seems like you've already made up your mind.

[17:46]
If you're that set on it, knock yourself out.

[17:48]
[laughs] Only if I do it wrong.

[17:51]
Because as I mentioned before, it's very dangerous.

[17:53]
-Have fun. -I'm serious. I'm really gonna do it.

[17:56]
Great. Put a towel down. Not one of the good ones.

[17:59]
[upbeat theme music playing]

[18:00]
[in unison] Morning time, Hollywoo.

[18:02]
I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.

[18:04]
And I'm An Actress Or Something, I don't know, sitting in for Some Lady.

[18:08]
-Whoa. What happened to her? -She got kidnapped.

[18:10]
Oh, boy.

[18:12]
[laughs] Oh, my. Ooh, wow.

[18:15]
Oh, hey. Look who survived to masturbate another day.

[18:19]
Well, I didn't do it yet, obviously.

[18:20]
If I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna go all out.

[18:22]
A big job like that needs lumber, and pulleys, lemons, so forth.

[18:25]
I'm not gonna half-ass anything. This is my orgasm we're talking about.

[18:29]
Okay. Well, I wish you all the best.

[18:31]
-Not too late to stop me. -I'm not gonna stop you.

[18:34]
-Good 'cause don't. -All right, we're in agreement.

[18:36]
Stop fighting!

[18:37]
Can't you two see what this is doing to me?

[18:39]
I've been acting out. [grunts]

[18:43]
Have a great day.

[18:45]
Todd? Get in the car.

[18:46]
It's time to get serious about auto-erotic asphyxiation.

[18:49]
Hooray! Question mark?

[18:56]
Just play it cool, Todd. No one needs to know why we're here.

[18:59]
Excuse me, I'm looking for something that will hold up a lot of weight.

[19:03]
Let's say something that could hoist up a horse comfortably by the neck.

[19:07]
Not for suicide purposes.

[19:09]
I'm trying to have a more fulfilling orgasm.

[19:15]
The world wept when news broke that J.D. Salinger died.

[19:19]
-[gasps] J.D. Salinger died? -But I'm here to tell you, he didn't die.

[19:23]
[gasps] J.D. Salinger didn't die?

[19:25]
As one of the [00:00]h century's most celebrated authors,

[19:28]
J.D. Salinger has inspired countless dreamers,

[19:31]
eighth graders and occasionally, assassins.

[19:33]
His spare lyricism and devotion to character

[19:36]
will undoubtedly translate into a penetrating dramatic work for this,

[19:40]
the golden age of television writing.

[19:42]
J.D. Take it away.

[19:44]
I wanna do a show where people ask celebrities trivia questions.

[19:48]
-What? -Like a game show?

[19:50]
Yeah. You know because since they're famous people,

[19:52]
I think normal people would wanna see if they know trivia and stuff.

[19:56]
You know, like, Hollywoo stars and celebrities, what do they know?

[20:00]
Do they know things? Let's find out.

[20:02]
What a hoot. I love it, and I don't use that word with just anybody.

[20:05]
What do you call it?

[20:06]
I call it Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities: What Do They Know?

[20:10]
Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out.

[20:12]
It's maybe more of a working title.

[20:14]
I can see it on the marquee already.

[20:16]
-Must be a long marquee. -It's long.

[20:18]
Yeah, yeah. The celebrities can also do physical challenges.

[20:21]
Oh, it's perfect.

[20:22]
We've been searching for a companion for Hey, I Think You Can Dance.

[20:25]
But wait, wait one second. Who's gonna host?

[20:28]
Huh. I've got the perfect guy.

[20:30]
Who wants to be in Nike Airs?

[20:34]
Claire, you are looking off the charts "gorge" in those tennis shoes.

[20:37]
But let me ask you this: Would you like to buy a towel?

[20:42]
Because I'm throwing one in for free.

[20:44]
-He's perfect. -[Wanda] Mm-hm.

[20:46]
Mr. Peanutbutter?

[20:48]
How would you like to be the host of J.D. Salinger's new celebrity game show?

[20:53]
What? I knew destiny had a plan for me.

[20:56]
You know, it just goes to show,

[20:58]
with the right attitude, every single one of your dreams

[21:01]
will always come true.

[21:02]
And if your dreams don't come true,

[21:04]
it's probably because you just didn't have the right attitude.

[21:10]
Today, one agent did something that no one else could.

[21:15]
I'll give you two hints: catcher and rye.

[21:18]
Oh. Nothing. It's nothing.

[21:20]
Charley Witherspoon caught a rye bagel coming out of the toaster.

[21:24]
-Come again? -It was coming fast and hot.

[21:27]
One day, some genius will invent some sort of bagel catcher

[21:31]
that takes the guesswork out of this task,

[21:33]
but until then, Charley gets a gold star.

[21:36]
-Thanks, Dad. I mean, Mr. Dad. -Oh...

[21:45]
Oh, boy.

[21:46]
Hey. Wasn't sure if I'd see you.

[21:48]
Still alive? Because auto-erotic asphyxiation is so risky?

[21:51]
Well, here I am, for now.

[21:53]
BoJack... Wait. Did you fix the bed?

[21:56]
Yeah. I was at the hardware store

[21:57]
picking up supplies for my auto-erotic asphyxiation machine.

[22:01]
Because, as you are aware,

[22:02]
I'm preparing to auto-erotic asphyxiate myself.

[22:05]
Figured I'd get stuff for the bed so you could at least get a good night's sleep.

[22:09]
Okay, BoJack.

[22:11]
Wanna talk about the elephant in the room?

[22:14]
Wow. Okay. You know what?

[22:17]
You know what? Here's-- First of all--

[22:20]
Wow. All right, I can't even-- [groans]

[22:24]
You know what? I-- [scoffs]

[22:27]
Wow.

[22:28]
He is never gonna forget that.

[22:29]
What is this all about?

[22:31]
This isn't about anything but the pursuit of the kind of orgasm

[22:34]
that feels like a rainbow with every color.

[22:36]
-So, a regular rainbow. -No.

[22:38]
So, if you don't mind, as long as you don't love me,

[22:41]
I have a noose to step into. [clears throat]

[22:43]
I just need to release this lever,

[22:45]
drop these bags of sand, which act as counterweights,

[22:47]
and then just pull this nozzle.

[22:50]
-Perfect. -Okay. Have fun.

[22:52]
-Wait, Wanda. [grunting and choking] -Okay, fine, you stupid baby.

[22:57]
I love you.

[22:59]
I-- [coughs] I knew it.

[23:02]
But I'm not going to tell you not to do the funky Spider-Man.

[23:05]
-[coughs] What? -You need to be responsible for yourself.

[23:08]
-That doesn't sound like me. -I know.

[23:10]
But if you love me, too, you won't do it.

[23:13]
[gasps then grunts]

[23:17]
-I thought so. -Okay.

[23:19]
Just for the record, I never really wanted to do this in the first place,

[23:22]
Me not doing it is not a sign that I love you.

[23:24]
-It's just because I'm a coward. -[chuckles] Okay.

[23:27]
-I don't love you. -Sure, you don't.

[23:28]
I don't. Come back here. I don't love you.

[23:31]
You don't make me feel less broken.

[23:37]
I don't get it.

[23:38]
I singlehandedly got a Lady Footlocker store employee a primetime show

[23:42]
and resurrected a certified dead man and nobody cared.

[23:47]
-Why do I do anything? -[Rutabaga over phone] Hey.

[23:50]
Do you need the movie star speech?

[23:52]
[sighs] Yeah.

[23:54]
Okay. Carolyn, you are the star of a movie.

[23:58]
This is the part of the movie where you get your heart broken.

[24:01]
Where the world tests you, and people treat you like shit.

[24:03]
But it has to happen this way.

[24:05]
Otherwise, the end of the movie,

[24:07]
when you get everything you want, won't feel as rewarding.

[24:10]
There are assholes out there, but in the end, they don't matter.

[24:14]
Because this movie's not about them.

[24:16]
It's never been about them.

[24:18]
All this time, the movie's been about you.

[24:22]
Thanks.

[24:24]
-Carolyn? -Yes, Rutabaga?

[24:27]
I think Katie and I are getting a divorce.

[24:32]
Corduroy? I don't want this thing anymore.

[24:34]
Corduroy?

[24:36]
Hey, you decent, man?

[24:38]
[gasps]

[24:39]
Oh, sweet Jesus.
