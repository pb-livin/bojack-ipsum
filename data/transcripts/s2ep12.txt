[00:14]
[Peanutbutter on recording] Look alive, bright eyes.

[00:17]
It's the morning and somebody loves you.

[00:19]
Right back at you, buddy.

[00:20]
-Oh, my God. He's here. -There he is.

[00:22]
-I love you, Mr. Peanutbutter. -I love you, too.

[00:26]
Idea for a new Pixar movie: what are pizza boxes thinking about?

[00:31]
-And Leland Stanford? -Transcontinental Railroad.

[00:34]
-Transcontinental Railroad? -That is correct.

[00:36]
Next question, what is my favorite kind of berry?

[00:41]
-Barry Bostwick. -Raspberry?

[00:43]
I'm so sorry, the correct answer, of course, was Barry Bostwick.

[00:46]
-How was I supposed to know? -He also likes Franken Berry.

[00:49]
-We would have accepted Franken Berry. -What?

[00:51]
-I'm sorry, you lose. -What the...?

[00:53]
That's our show, but before we go I wanna send out a quick message.

[00:57]
Diane, if you're watching this, I love you and I know you're doing great things.

[01:03]
Idea for a new app: an undo button that could undo long amounts of time.

[01:08]
-Hey, is everyone having a good time? Ha! -Three months. A year. A life.

[01:15]
Erica, where did that tooth come from? All right, let's keep this party going.

[01:20]
One click and everything could just go back to the way it was.

[01:24]
[grunts]

[01:26]
[sighs]

[01:29]
-Hey. -[BoJack] Hey.

[01:31]
-You're still here? -Yup. Still here.

[01:37]
[♪♪]

[02:34]
[snoring, then grunts]

[02:37]
-Stop it. -Wake up, captain dumbshit.

[02:39]
I've been trying to get in touch with you for two months.

[02:42]
Ow. Okay. I'm awake, I'm awake.

[02:45]
Aah! What is it?

[02:47]
If the studio wants to sue me, tell them to take my house. I belong to the sea now.

[02:52]
-Are you drunk? -Only on adventure. And gin.

[02:56]
And vodka. And gin.

[02:57]
They're not gonna sue you. They finished the movie.

[03:00]
-What? How? Explain yourself, land wench. -I don't know, ask Turteltaub.

[03:04]
That's not why I'm here. I thought you were in Cordovia.

[03:07]
You've been here this whole time?

[03:09]
Idea for a thing Princess Carolyn should do... Shut up.

[03:13]
Get dressed. We're going to the orphanage.

[03:15]
[grunts] What orphanage?

[03:16]
Remember at Herb's funeral, I asked you what you wanted me to do

[03:19]
-with your Horsin' Around residuals? -I do... not remember that.

[03:23]
You said, "Give it to an orphanage or something."

[03:25]
-What? -It turns out you made enough money

[03:28]
to build a brand new one. So congratulations. You're a hero.

[03:32]
A hero?

[03:34]
That's right, a hero.

[03:37]
Or is it pronounced "gyro?" I just call them subs.

[03:39]
Anyway, enjoy the sandwich, you're a great man.

[03:42]
Welcome to The BoJack Horseman Orphanage.

[03:46]
Or, as we call it, The BoJack Horsephanage.

[03:49]
You cannot call it that.

[03:50]
A, because I am not a great man and B, because that is a really stupid name.

[03:55]
-The name was Molly's idea. -Stop pissing off the orphans.

[03:59]
A lot of them grow up to be serial killers.

[04:02]
♪ BoJack's a very kind fellow BoJack's a very kind fellow ♪

[04:06]
♪ BoJack's a very kind fellow ♪

[04:10]
♪ He gave us a place to live ♪

[04:16]
Thank you for that lovely song. But I'm not a good person.

[04:20]
This is the only good thing I've ever done and I did it by accident.

[04:23]
And it just goes to show you life is just... Ah, what am I saying?

[04:26]
I don't have to tell you how hard life is. You're the ones with the dead parents.

[04:30]
-My parents are dead? -No. No. Not necessarily.

[04:33]
Maybe they just didn't want you.

[04:35]
My point is, I don't understand how people live.

[04:39]
It's amazing to me that people wake up every morning

[04:42]
and say, "Yeah, another day, let's do it." How do people do it?

[04:46]
I don't know how.

[04:48]
Yay.

[04:57]
So you see, Todd, the nimble improviser must navigate the most sensitive of areas.

[05:03]
-And I'm not just talking about the butt. -Ha.

[05:05]
Copernicus, how do you always come up with these amazing butt jokes?

[05:09]
When you're a Level Nine, as I am, you don't come up with butt jokes.

[05:14]
You live truthfully in the moment and the butt joke comes to you.

[05:18]
So true. So wise.

[05:20]
Listen, I need to "shove off," as we sailors say,

[05:23]
on my comedy cruise line, the Giggleship. I shan't be returning.

[05:27]
-Shan't you? -I shannot.

[05:29]
I'd like you to join me on the high seas, as my Number Two

[05:32]
and I don't mean that kind of number two.

[05:35]
What, number two, how do you do that?

[05:41]
If it isn't the furshlugginer putz who cost me 50 grand.

[05:44]
I'm sorry I bailed in the middle of production. If there's anything I can do.

[05:48]
Do? What do? Movie's finished.

[05:50]
-We fixed the whole thing in post. -Really?

[05:52]
Remember your first week, these nerds made a computer scan of your head

[05:55]
so we could finish if something happened?

[05:57]
Please don't call us nerds, sir.

[05:59]
Something happened to you, so these nerds finished the movie.

[06:02]
Look what Computer BoJack can do.

[06:04]
-Help you out of that tree, ma'am? -Look at him save that cat.

[06:07]
Now there's a protagonist we can root for.

[06:09]
-You did all that in the computer? -Not just that.

[06:12]
Computer BoJack had so much charisma and screen presence we ended up going back

[06:16]
-and replacing you in every scene. -I'm not in the movie at all?

[06:19]
Not technically, but computer you is giving the performance of your career.

[06:23]
When people see what you do in this movie,

[06:25]
they are gonna storm Daniel Day-Lewis's house,

[06:27]
schlep him out into the street, shoot him in the head.

[06:30]
That's how good your performance is.

[06:32]
It's gonna make Daniel Day-Lewis look like shit.

[06:34]
-They're gonna hate Daniel Day-Lewis. -But it's not my performance.

[06:37]
Explain that the widow Day-Lewis. She'll be devastated. Kaput. Kapleshky.

[06:41]
Are you Jewish? Because I feel some of these you're just making up.

[06:44]
We got a screening this weekend.

[06:46]
Come see the movie, we'll schmooze, we'll kibitz,

[06:49]
schlemiel, schlimazel, Hasenpfeffer Incorporated.

[06:55]
Just think, Carolyn, in one week, all of this will be ours.

[06:58]
We should a put a social-media desk there.

[07:01]
If we hire someone to micromanage our clients' online personas

[07:04]
and new media outreach, they'll seem more grounded down to earth.

[07:07]
Smiling poop emoji, I love everything about that.

[07:10]
I wanna make sure the couches we get are really comfortable.

[07:14]
-Just in case we have some late nights. -[laughs] Mr. Rabitowitz.

[07:18]
This is a place of business.

[07:20]
Ugh, can we just freeze in this moment for a second?

[07:23]
I just wanna remember this instant where for once in my life,

[07:27]
-everything was going-- -Hold that thought.

[07:29]
What is it?

[07:30]
Ugh. My wife and I are going to the ballet tonight,

[07:32]
there's a real ish with the restaurant.

[07:34]
-This is the wife you're divorcing, right? -You know how it is.

[07:37]
You say you want a divorce and she says, "No, we can make this work."

[07:40]
You go to counseling and remember why you fell in love with her

[07:43]
in the first place and then, blah, blah, it's a whole thing.

[07:45]
We've been sleeping together for three months.

[07:48]
-We're about to start a company together. -None of that has to change.

[07:51]
I am definitely going to divorce her probably, it's just...

[07:55]
Ugh. It's hard to explain to someone who's never been married.

[07:58]
-Listen, this is-- -Oh!

[07:59]
Sorry, Katie just said something funny.

[08:02]
-What? -I gotta hop. I love you, though.

[08:10]
Ha, ha. Okay, keep the engine running, I'll be back in a-- Oh.

[08:15]
-Hey. -Hey.

[08:17]
Um, I'm just here to pick up some stuff. I'm going away for a while.

[08:21]
-Oh, where? -The Giggleship.

[08:23]
It's the comedy cruise line People magazine

[08:26]
-once called "a comedy cruise line." -Comedy cruise line?

[08:30]
Oh right, your improv thing. How was your, uh, graduation show?

[08:34]
-It was two months ago. You missed it. -Sorry.

[08:38]
-No, you're not. -Well...

[08:39]
Hey, do you remember the morning after my first night here?

[08:44]
I don't know why everyone keeps asking if I remember things. I don't.

[08:47]
Just as a general rule, if your question begins, "Do you remember"

[08:50]
and doesn't end with "how much you hated Moulin Rouge," the answer's no.

[08:54]
I was so happy to have a place to stay that I made pancakes.

[08:58]
And you kept eating them so I kept making them.

[09:00]
And then you got mad at me for letting you eat so many pancakes.

[09:04]
You tried to chase me around the pool, but you were too hungover

[09:07]
and also full from the pancakes so instead... you took a nap.

[09:12]
And when you woke up, you said, "Thanks for the pancakes.

[09:17]
-Now get out of my house." -I don't remember any of that.

[09:20]
Well, anyway, I'm finally moving out, just like you wanted.

[09:25]
Good. Honestly, you'll probably be better off without me.

[09:28]
[sighs]

[09:30]
Yeah. But we had some good times, though, right?

[09:33]
-Did we? -Right. Well, um, take care.

[09:39]
Hey, I hope you can find a way to be happy, BoJack.

[09:42]
-I really do. -Yeah, okay.

[09:47]
Hey, Todd?

[09:51]
You need to get your shit together.

[09:54]
-Ugh. -Rutabaga and I are starting a new agency.

[09:57]
I want you to come onboard and write celebrity tweets.

[10:01]
-I don't know how to do that. -You're a ghost-writer.

[10:03]
It's the same as writing a book, they're just a lot shorter

[10:06]
and more people read them.

[10:08]
All right, but why are you helping me?

[10:11]
Because my life is a mess right now and I compulsively take care of other people

[10:15]
when I don't know how to take care of myself.

[10:16]
Oh. I was hoping it was because you believed in me.

[10:20]
I don't.

[10:25]
Welcome to my Giggleship.

[10:26]
For us, it's a place to realize our higher selves. For the paying public,

[10:30]
it's a place to watch improv and drink watered-down margaritas for 8.99.

[10:34]
Wow, we must all make a lot of money.

[10:37]
No, no, you just get paid in experience and stage time.

[10:42]
-Which in a way is even better than money. -Say what?

[10:46]
Look, We've arrived at your living quarters.

[10:48]
Wow. No more couch-sleeping for this guy. He gets a mattress.

[10:54]
That's the spirit.

[10:55]
And you can use improv to make this room anything you want it to be.

[10:59]
My cabin is exactly like yours, but when I use my imagination,

[11:03]
it becomes a rich stateroom with a treasure chest full of booty.

[11:06]
I like a big booty, if you know what I mean. And I don't mean a butt.

[11:10]
[laughing]

[11:12]
You really are the master of spontaneous witticisms.

[11:19]
[sighs]

[11:21]
All right, you ready? This is go time. There's no turning back now.

[11:24]
-Oh, I am ready. -Great.

[11:26]
Now let's get out there and tell all those garbage rat bastard sons of bastards

[11:30]
what we really think of them, once and for all.

[11:32]
Everyone. We have an announcement.

[11:35]
-[crying] -Guys, we have an announcement.

[11:37]
-What's going on? -Mr. Witherspoon's in the hospital.

[11:40]
-He had a stroke. -Oh.

[11:43]
Well, you know what you rat bastards can stroke?

[11:46]
-Uh... Oh. -My big, hairy...

[11:48]
[all gasp]

[11:49]
Well, we burned that bridge.

[11:55]
[both laughing]

[11:57]
Todd, you should be up a magician's sleeve because you are a card.

[12:02]
[shouting]

[12:03]
Hey, Bryan. What's going on here?

[12:06]
-He refused to scrub the floors. -Oh, Bryan.

[12:09]
Please. My knees were cramping so I needed to stand.

[12:12]
But I'm real good at cleaning windows. Look.

[12:16]
That's solid space-work. Bryan, don't worry.

[12:20]
I'm gonna go to Copernicus and get this sorted out.

[12:23]
Copernicus? Uh, Copernicus?

[12:28]
Huh?

[12:31]
Huh.

[12:34]
Whoa.

[12:39]
One Hundred and One Butt Jokes?

[12:42]
"No parking in the rear?" [laughs] Aah!

[12:47]
-Copernicus is a fraud! -A fraud? Me? Ow.

[12:51]
-Aah. -I had such high hopes for you, Todd.

[12:54]
Normally, I'd make a perfectly timed butt joke here,

[12:57]
but as you can see, I don't have my book.

[13:00]
-Oh! -Guards, take this subversive

[13:02]
to the Yes And room.

[13:04]
-No. -Hey, what are you doing?

[13:07]
No. Shame on all of you! Just wait till you see my Trip Advisor review.

[13:12]
This cruise is getting three stars.

[13:14]
Because I have very mixed feelings about it.

[13:21]
-Carolyn, we are free. -Yeah.

[13:24]
Real quick, kiss me once. Then kiss me twice.

[13:26]
I don't want to do that anymore.

[13:28]
-I told you, we can make this work-- -No. I don't want--

[13:32]
Carolyn, you're a single woman in your 40s.

[13:34]
-Can you really afford to be picky? -What?

[13:37]
I'm just saying, what, you think you're gonna find some perfect unattached guy

[13:40]
who's gonna love you like I do?

[13:42]
Who's gonna make you laugh and feel good about yourself?

[13:45]
This is it, Carolyn, this is what you get.

[13:47]
If you're holding out for something better,

[13:49]
well, I hate to break it to you, but you're gonna be alone for a long time.

[13:53]
I'm not afraid of being alone.

[13:57]
And you might wanna find someplace else to work

[13:59]
-because you're not coming with me. -Wait, wait, wait, what?

[14:03]
It's my company. My name is on all the paperwork.

[14:05]
I think I can do it without you. Good luck.

[14:08]
-Whoa, Carolyn, we just-- Come... Carolyn. -My name is Princess Carolyn.

[14:16]
[BoJack voice-over] And as I held that baby in my arms,

[14:19]
I knew I had been given a second chance.

[14:21]
A chance to finally make things right. And this time, I was gonna win...

[14:27]
the race of life.

[14:29]
-[Rock music playing] -[crowd cheering]

[14:32]
-Whoa. That was actually good. -We're doing a full awards push.

[14:38]
You should clear your schedule for the next year.

[14:40]
Buckle up, buddy, this is the year of Secretariat.

[14:42]
But it wasn't Secretariat. And it wasn't me. It was a computer.

[14:46]
What difference does it make? Smile and collect your trophies.

[14:49]
-You know Ana Spanikopita? -Hello.

[14:51]
-Aah! -They call her the Oscar whisperer.

[14:54]
-Ana Spanikopita. Big fan. -Thank you, it's--

[14:56]
I meant you are going to be a big fan of me

[14:59]
because I am going to win you an Oscar.

[15:01]
Ana is the best there is.

[15:03]
-You better start writing your speech. -I don't have to thank my parents, do I?

[15:06]
You're funny. I am literally laughing out loud.

[15:09]
-Uh... -We gotta get you on a talk show.

[15:10]
You have any weird history with Kelly Ripa I should know about?

[15:13]
-No. Well, define "weird." -You look doughy. Do you run?

[15:17]
-Cardio? Anything? -I mean, occasionally.

[15:20]
Excuse me? That was such a beautiful performance.

[15:23]
-So brave. -Thank you.

[15:25]
Everyone here loves you. Do you feel that?

[15:28]
-Feel that energy! -They don't love me.

[15:30]
-They don't know me. -That's why they love you.

[15:32]
He's right. Our research shows America likes to think they know you,

[15:36]
and then they like learning more about you, but at a certain point

[15:39]
they pass a threshold where they actually know you and then they find you weird

[15:43]
and off-putting.

[15:45]
Are you saying that nobody who really knows me could ever love me?

[15:48]
-No, no, no. Not nobody. No. -No.

[15:51]
What am I doing here?

[15:53]
I don't know where you're going, but if you could run there.

[16:08]
Sextina, hi. Thanks for meeting me here. I'm really excited to be working with you.

[16:13]
Listen, chitch, if you're going to tweet for Sextina Aquafina,

[16:17]
you need to capture the essence of my personal brand, okay?

[16:19]
All upper caps, no punctuation, lots of cryptic bullshit about the Illuminati

[16:23]
and make sure to mention my preferred brands, okay?

[16:26]
Beats by Dre, Abercrombie and Fitch and [clicking] brand fin polish.

[16:32]
-Can you spell that last one? -No.

[16:36]
I gotta go get my blowhole bleached.

[16:39]
Hey, thank you so much. You people are the real stars. Huh?

[16:48]
[cell phone ringing]

[16:49]
[Koenig on recording] Hi. I'm Sarah Koenig.

[16:51]
This is one ringtone told over the course of several rings.

[16:55]
And the story it's telling you is to answer your phone.

[16:59]
-Hello? -Hey, Diane.

[17:02]
Hey. Uh...

[17:04]
So... How's Cordovia?

[17:09]
It's... hard.

[17:11]
-Do you know where the batteries are? -What?

[17:17]
-The batteries in the remote died. -Did you check the junk drawer?

[17:22]
Yeah, I looked in the junk drawer.

[17:24]
I'm gonna take them out of the smoke detector.

[17:26]
-No, don't do that. -Well, I'm out of options.

[17:29]
Listen, I know this sounds crazy, but I think maybe you should get back here

[17:35]
-so you can help me find the batteries. -Yeah?

[17:39]
I know you're doing important work and it's a long way to travel,

[17:42]
but I need you here and I think you should come home.

[17:46]
-Is that really what you want? -Of course it is.

[17:51]
Well, okay, I'm looking at this website right now

[17:57]
and it says if I leave immediately, I can still make it home tonight.

[18:01]
-That sounds great. -I love you.

[18:05]
I love you, too, Diane. You know, it's the funniest thing.

[18:09]
There is a woman in this restaurant who looks just like you.

[18:12]
[chuckles] I guess I just have one of those faces.

[18:16]
[all shouting and laughing]

[18:19]
Okay, party people, we have time for one more suggestion.

[18:23]
-Todd. -Did someone say movie theater?

[18:25]
I heard movie theater.

[18:27]
I'm Abe Lincoln and I'm gonna wear my giant hat to the movies.

[18:31]
Who's this sitting behind me? John Wilkes Booth. Uh-oh.

[18:35]
-Todd, it's me, BoJack. -BoJack?

[18:39]
-Todd, I'm getting you out of here. -I can't leave.

[18:42]
I need to take suggestions.

[18:43]
Okay, well, here's a suggestion, your name is Todd.

[18:47]
You're 24, you live on my couch and you've always seen the good in me somehow.

[18:54]
You've been brainwashed into thinking

[18:55]
that you belong here, but you don't. You belong back home.

[18:58]
If you're any kind of improviser, you'll take that suggestion

[19:01]
and you'll run with it.

[19:02]
Huh.

[19:05]
Let's get out of here.

[19:07]
I'm afraid that getting out of here is not an option.

[19:10]
-You've seen too much. -What the hell are you gonna do about it?

[19:14]
-Stop you. With these. -Oh, no.

[19:17]
-Don't do anything crazy, guys. -You can't be serious.

[19:20]
-Just get behind me, BoJack. -No sudden moves.

[19:22]
Be reasonable. You wouldn't wanna puncture the hull.

[19:25]
Especially not when I have this smoke bomb. Ka-pow!

[19:29]
-I've lost them. Where did they go? -Seriously?

[19:31]
Now feel the wrath of my flamethrower.

[19:36]
Too bad we're wearing sunscreen

[19:38]
with SPF a million which protects against flamethrowers.

[19:42]
Oh, no.

[19:43]
Now we finish this with our strangle machine.

[19:46]
Beep, boop, boop. Machine?

[19:48]
-Strangle those guys. -Ugh! [coughs] BoJack, help.

[19:52]
[gasping]

[19:54]
There is literally nothing happening to you.

[19:56]
You don't understand, if you die in improv, you die in real life.

[20:01]
So stupid. Fine. I guess I have a guard killing machine?

[20:05]
Beep, boop, beep.

[20:06]
[gasps] No. I have a wife and children.

[20:09]
Well, they're improvised, but they're real to me.

[20:12]
[all shouting]

[20:14]
-Can this be the end? -This whole ship is full of idiots.

[20:20]
Beep, boop.

[20:26]
Come on, come on, come on.

[20:28]
Come on, come on, Todd. Almost there.

[20:30]
Wait. Where are you going?

[20:32]
Sorry, improv is fun and great and everything,

[20:35]
but you guys are really into improv. I'm gonna go with my friend.

[20:40]
Your friend? I didn't realize this man was your friend.

[20:43]
Well, then, by all means, go with him, Todd.

[20:46]
But, see, I thought this was the man who sabotaged your rock opera.

[20:51]
The one who constantly abuses you and makes you shower with a hose in the yard.

[20:55]
I invited him to.

[20:57]
The one who's never said a kind word to you the entire time you've known him.

[21:00]
-Is this your friend, Todd? -It's more complicated than that.

[21:06]
-Is it? We're your friends, Todd. -More than that, we're a family.

[21:10]
-I, uh... -Hash browns.

[21:15]
-What? -I heard hash browns.

[21:16]
-Martha, did you see my hash browns? -Oh, my God, do you ever turn it off?

[21:20]
It was hash browns, not pancakes. The first morning you stayed with me.

[21:24]
You kept making them and I kept eating them and then I threw up in the pool.

[21:28]
That made you throw up in the pool. Then I got mad at you for throwing up in my pool.

[21:32]
-But, you said, "I'll clean it up." -And did I clean it up?

[21:35]
No. You didn't. I had to call the pool cleaner.

[21:38]
-Ha, ha. -And you said,

[21:40]
"Thank you for letting me stay here.

[21:41]
I don't have anywhere else to go." And I remember when you said that,

[21:45]
"I don't have anywhere else to go," because I felt good about myself.

[21:49]
And I don't feel that way a lot.

[21:52]
Letting you stay with me was the best thing I ever did on purpose.

[21:55]
I don't think I ever told you that. But I should have.

[21:58]
Because you're my best friend, Todd.

[22:02]
I'm not gonna lie, if you just made all that up, that was some really good improv.

[22:06]
Game recognize game.

[22:11]
-Why do you have a boat? -Uh, I don't remember.

[22:14]
[distorted ringtone playing on phone]

[22:17]
-Hello? Prince? -Listen, bozo, I keep getting calls

[22:21]
from this New York playwright, she really wants to talk to you.

[22:24]
-She says you know her, Jill Pill? -Jill Pill?

[22:27]
Ring any bells? Apparently, she worked on your TV show.

[22:30]
-Horsin' Around? -No, actually. The other TV show.

[22:33]
Other TV show? Oh, shit. Jill.

[22:36]
I'm moving into the new office and I got Herb's ashes here.

[22:39]
I really don't know what to do with this thing.

[22:42]
-Do you want it? -Yeah.

[22:44]
[smashing noise over phone]

[22:45]
Why did I take you with me?

[22:50]
Herb loved orphans.

[22:52]
Mostly as a delivery apparatus for hackneyed punchlines

[22:55]
and mawkish sentimentality, but still.

[22:57]
And we will do our part to honor his legacy.

[23:00]
-Hey, who's Jerb? -What?

[23:01]
Jerb Ka-- Why does it say "Jerb Kazzaz?"

[23:04]
Your e-mail said "Jerb." I forwarded it to the plaque guy.

[23:08]
-Is it not--? -No, obviously that was a typo.

[23:10]
Why would I want to dedicate the orphanage to the memory of Jerb Kazzaz?

[23:14]
Kind of sounds like something you'd get at a Mediterranean restaurant,

[23:17]
but wouldn't finish.

[23:19]
And the waiter would say, "You want me to box up this jerb kazzaz for you?"

[23:22]
-And you'd say, "No." -You gotta fix this.

[23:25]
Really? We spent a lot of money on this plaque, you know?

[23:28]
-And on the t-shirts. -Jerb's kids?

[23:31]
No, there's no Jerb. It's Herb.

[23:33]
T-shirt's say Jerb so I'm going by the t-shirts.

[23:37]
[groans]

[23:38]
You know, Herb would probably think that this is pretty funny

[23:42]
-that you couldn't even get this right. -Yeah. He would.

[23:47]
-So, in a way... -Yeah.

[23:51]
You wanna get some Mediterranean food?

[23:52]
You read my mind.

[23:56]
[panting]

[23:58]
Oh, God. Lungs on fire.

[24:04]
[groaning]

[24:07]
Ow. Crap. I hate this. Running is terrible.

[24:11]
Everything is the worst.

[24:13]
[continues panting]

[24:18]
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

[24:23]
-It gets easier. -Huh?

[24:25]
Every day, it gets a little easier.

[24:28]
-Yeah? -But you gotta do it every day.

[24:31]
That's the hard part. But it does get easier.

[24:35]
[panting]

[24:38]
Okay.
