[00:16]
So... should we talk about how you just tried to kiss me?

[00:20]
No, I don't think we need to talk about that.

[00:22]
Yeah, you're right. What's to talk about, right?

[00:25]
We're f-friends, right?

[00:27]
- Oh, yeah, totally. - Yeah, friends.

[00:29]
And I think it's important that we stay friends.

[00:32]
Yeah, I agree.

[00:33]
And be friends with each other.

[00:36]
- Yeah, friends. - And also to each other.

[00:39]
Plus, hey, you're getting married.

[00:41]
That's right. Next summer.

[00:42]
Nantucket is great in the summer.

[00:44]
Not like L.A., which is so hot and dry.

[00:47]
- [laughs] - It is arid.

[00:49]
[brakes squeak]

[00:51]
Well... see you later!

But wait, doesn't Diane want to marry Mr. Peanutbutter?

[02:06]
No, see, she thinks she does, but she actually doesn't.

[02:10]
That's why we need to be good friends right now,

[02:12]

and sabotage our friend's engagement.

Oh...

I got here as soon as I could. What's the emergency?

We got to figure out a way to stop Diane's wedding.

[02:24]
[clears throat] Okay.

[02:25]
So when you woke me up in the middle of the night

[02:27]
and told me to rush over here because of an "emergency,"

[02:29]
the emergency you were referring to

[02:32]
was Diane getting married a year from now?

[02:34]
- Yeah, you got any ideas? - I'm done.

[02:36]
I'm not going to waste another thought on you.

[02:38]
I am at a bar. It's the weekend.

[02:40]
I'm gonna enjoy myself.

Look, if you don't have any ideas,

Vincent Adultman.

Ya hear that, BoJack?

[02:58]
Vincent is an adult,

[03:00]
and I'll bet he knows how to treat a lady.

[03:02]
He very clearly isn't and doesn't.

Would you like alcohol?

I certainly would,

you sophisticated smooth talker.

Mmm! Tell me all about you.

Mm...

I like business... transactions.

Are you seriously trying to make me jealous

[03:20]
by flirting with what is very obviously

[03:22]
just three kids stacked on top

[03:24]
of each other under a trench coat?

[03:26]
Vinnie, what does a guy like you do for fun?

[03:28]
I don't have time for these shenanigans.

I got a wedding to shanghai.

Good luck with your business transactions.

Can you... drive me everywhere I need to go

I really can't, sweetheart. I'm super busy.

[04:25]
Oh, you're working on our wedding registry.

[04:28]
- I'm writing my book. - Right.

[04:30]
But don't forget about the registry.

[04:32]
Mr. Peanutbutter, you know I love you.

[04:34]
And you know I am really excited about getting married,

[04:37]
but right now I'm working,

[04:38]
and I have a lot of thoughts in my head,

[04:40]
and I can't really think about our wedding

[04:41]
or the future or me being married to you.

[04:43]
Okay. What's going on?

[04:45]
Talk to me like I'm Michelle Pfeiffer

[04:46]
in the Coolio video.

[04:47]
Just-- Well, um... with the leg--

[04:50]
Hmm, all right.

[04:51]
And Coolio.

[04:52]
Nothing's going on.

[04:54]
It's just that this wedding is kind of

[04:55]
starting to feel like a lot.

[04:57]
Honey, relax. Getting married is easy.

[05:00]
I mean, I've already done it twice.

[05:02]
It's fine. I'm sorry.

[05:03]
I just... need to focus on the book right now.

[05:06]
So that's still a no on driving me around?

[05:09]
- Why don't you hire a driver? - Eh-eh-eh-deh--

[05:11]
Is there a light bulb above my head?

[05:13]
Because while you were talking, I just got an amazing idea.

[05:16]
I should hire a driver!

[05:18]
Oh, this will be a romp.

[05:20]
[laughs] If I know me, this will be a romp.

[05:27]
I'm not sure how I feel

[05:29]
about breaking and entering, BoJack.

[05:30]
Well, that's the beauty part.

[05:32]
The B&amp;E is really the least illegal piece

[05:35]

[05:36]
- Have you got your tool kit? - Check.

[05:38]
- Burner phone? - Check.

[05:39]
- Cyanide capsule? - Check.

[05:40]
Wait, why do we need--

[05:41]
Okay, let's get started.

[05:42]
Step one: Enter the study.

[05:47]
[glass shatters]

[05:51]
Step two: Plant incriminating--

[05:53]
- Hello? Todd? - Uh...

[05:56]
- Hi, Mr. Peanutbutter. - Take the cyanide, Todd.

[05:59]
Take the cyanide!

[06:00]
[panting]

[06:02]
And hup. Hup.

[06:03]
And hup-- No.

[06:05]
Are you here to interview to be my driver?

[06:07]
Um... yes, I am.

[06:10]
Brilliant.

[06:11]
I didn't even post the ad yet.

[06:12]
Here's me thinking destiny over here.

[06:15]
And hup. Yeah!

[06:16]
Hu-aah! [crash]

[06:17]
[car alarm blares]

[06:18]
[car alarm chirps]

[06:20]
Thank you for your interest in the role of driver.

[06:22]
I know you don't have your resume with you,

[06:24]
so I've taken the liberty of letting you use mine.

[06:27]
Yeah, thanks.

[06:28]
Here, business boss.

[06:30]
Let's just have a look here. Mm-hmm.

[06:32]
Oh, ho, with a resume like this,

[06:34]
you should be the one hiring a driver.

[06:36]
[laughs] Just kidding.

[06:37]
I know it's my resume.

[06:39]
But I see you went to Northwestern.

[06:40]
You know, I'm an N.U. man myself.

[06:42]
Go, fighting Westerns.

[06:44]
And it says here you do

[06:45]
a great Rodney Dangerfield impression.

[06:47]
Give us a taste.

[06:48]
Uh, okay.

[06:50]
"I'm Roger Dangerfield."

[06:52]
[laughs] No respect, indeed.

[06:54]
Todd, you got the job.

[06:58]
Oh.

[06:59]
Can you believe this weather we're having?

[07:01]
No, I cannot believe this weather we're having!

[07:04]
[laughs]

[07:06]
Oh, wow. We make a great pair.

[07:08]
It's like I'm Miss Daisy, and you're Minnie Driver.

[07:12]
[lawn mower rattling]

[07:15]
- [phone beeps] - Hey, I'm bored.

[07:16]
And I think Todd swallowed a cyanide pill

[07:18]
and might be dead.

[07:19]
Wanna come over and bang it out?

[07:21]
Appealing as that sounds,

[07:22]
I have lunch plans with Vincent.

[07:24]
I know that might be hard for you to hear.

[07:26]
Wait, that guy from the bar who is actually three boys

[07:29]
stacked on top of each other under a trench coat?

[07:31]
Well, don't fly into a jealous rage about it.

[07:33]
Not jealous.

[07:34]
Just reminding you that you are trying

[07:35]
to have a relationship with someone who is--

[07:37]
and again, it's bizarre

[07:38]
I should have to point this out-- three young boys

[07:40]
stacked on top of each other under a trench coat.

[07:42]
He listens to me.

[07:45]
Okay, okay, but can you just acknowledge that--

[07:46]
- That you are being jealous? - Oh, oh!

[07:48]
- [glass shatters] - Already acknowledged.

[07:49]
- Toodles. - [phone beeps]

[07:50]
- Look who's not dead. - Better than not dead.

[07:53]
You are looking at Mr. Peanutbutter's new driver.

[07:56]
You're his driver? That's perfect.

[07:58]
Now you can infiltrate Mr. Peanutbutter's inner circle.

[08:01]
I don't know, BoJack.

[08:03]
Sure, you'll act all friendly,

[08:04]
gain his trust, chauffer him around

[08:06]
on his little errands to the groomer and whatnot,

[08:08]
but all the while, you'll be studying him,

[08:10]
scouring out his weaknesses,

[08:12]
biding your time till we're ready to strike.

[08:15]
And once you zero in on his Achilles' heel,

[08:18]
we will take... him... down.

[08:22]
Hooray. Betrayal.

[08:26]
[warbling]

[08:29]
Oh, man. Oh, man.

[08:30]
- Keep it cool, Todd. - Hey, pal.

[08:31]
If you're making small talk up there,

[08:33]
how about sending a little my way?

[08:36]
Um... can you believe this weather we're having?

[08:39]
No, I cannot believe this weather we're having!

[08:45]
[doorbell rings, horse neighs]

[08:47]
Hey, weren't you supposed to be here

[08:48]
like a half hour ago?

[08:49]
Yeah, I've just been sitting in my car.

[08:52]
[chuckles]

[08:53]
Listen, I was looking over my notes,

[08:55]
and I think I have enough to go write the book,

[08:57]
so... I'm just going to do that.

[09:02]
You don't want to interview me anymore?

[09:04]
But don't you want to know what my Rosebud is?

[09:05]
You told me repeatedly it was the nudie magazine

[09:08]
your uncle showed you with the three-nippled woman.

[09:09]
- Who was she? - I got it all.

[09:11]
Oh, okay.

[09:12]
Well, I'll see you around though, right?

[09:14]
Yeah. I, um--

[09:17]
Why did you have to make things weird, BoJack?

[09:21]
[car door opens, closes]

[09:23]
I made things weird?

[09:26]
[Mr. Peanutbutter] So if you see anything

[09:27]
you know we need, like this biscuit warmer,

[09:29]
you just run the laser over the barcode,

[09:31]
- and kablamsky! - [beep]

[09:32]
It goes in the registry.

[09:34]
And that way, everybody knows what I want.

[09:35]
- And I know what I want. - Uh...

[09:37]
Which is what everyone wants.

[09:38]
And it's really clear,

[09:40]
and nobody's confused about anything.

[09:41]
Am I crazy, or are you not into this?

[09:44]
No, I am. It's just-- [sighs]

[09:46]
The big wedding in Nantucket, all these presents--

[09:49]
I'm so overwhelmed, I can barely consider

[09:51]
whether I want or need a biscuit warmer,

[09:54]
which I think is how people end up with biscuit warmers.

[09:56]
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

[09:58]
Close your eyes. Come on.

[10:00]
Okay, picture our lives together.

[10:01]
It's a cold Sunday morning a bunch of years from now.

[10:04]
Maybe robots have taken over, maybe they haven't.

[10:06]
I don't know. It's the future.

[10:07]
This story isn't about that.

[10:09]
The important thing is it's Sunday morning.

[10:11]
I brought you the paper, fetched your slippers.

[10:13]
You come into the kitchen-- Can you smell biscuits?

[10:16]
- Yes. - So can I.

[10:19]
- Are they warm? - Yeah.

[10:20]
Well, that's all a biscuit warmer's for.

[10:22]
Look, if marriage stresses you out,

[10:24]
we don't have to get married.

[10:26]
It's not the marriage.

[10:28]
It's the wedding and the year of build-up.

[10:30]
So forget all that.

[10:32]
I've done the whole big wedding thing.

[10:33]
I don't need to do it again.

[10:34]
Let's do something small and casual

[10:36]
right here in town next month.

[10:38]
Honestly, that would be amazing.

[10:40]
But we'd have to cancel the doves,

[10:42]
and we wouldn't be able to send out

[10:43]
those fancy invitations you liked.

[10:45]
Those doves were being jerks anyway.

[10:47]
And invitations-- They're just a scam

[10:49]
made up by the Post Office to keep tabs on us.

[10:51]
Post Office.

[10:52]
- [growls] - Settle down, boy.

[10:54]
[Todd] And then we talked about his favorite Smash Mouth CDs.

[10:57]
[crunching] And-- Oh, oh.

[10:59]
And then that led to a whole conversations about sticks.

[11:03]
Oh, and let me tell you,

[11:05]
Mr. Peanutbutter has got some serious opinions about sticks.

[11:09]
Why are you telling me this?

[11:11]
What? You said you wanted every detail.

[11:12]
Did I mention he got a new bandana?

[11:14]
Give me something I can use

[11:15]
to make them call off their wedding.

[11:17]
Oh, yeah. Did I not tell you?

[11:18]
They called off their wedding.

[11:19]
What? Thank God!

[11:21]
Oh, the universe makes sense.

[11:23]
They decided against a big destination wedding,

[11:25]
so they're doing it here

[11:26]
- sometime next month. - What?

[11:28]
I guess saying they called it off

[11:29]
is probably not right.

[11:31]
[groans]

[11:32]
[ominous music]

[11:34]
Hey, what's this?

[11:35]
Oh, yes, I got jury duty,

[11:37]
but I can't worry about that right now.

[11:39]
That is a problem for Friday BoJack.

[11:40]
Now think, Todd. Gotta have something I can use

[11:43]
sloshing around in that pot-infused Jell-O shot

[11:45]
- you call a brain. - Let's see.

[11:47]
Mr. Peanutbutter likes having his tummy scratched,

[11:51]
and Diane's family is from Vietnam,

[11:53]
which is where Vietnamese food comes from,

[11:56]
and since that goes in your tummy--

[11:58]
Okay, stop thinking. Just give me raw data.

[12:00]
What's happening this week?

[12:01]
Well, the circus is in town.

[12:03]
Congress is going to vote on the new Education Bill--

[12:05]
With Mr. Peanutbutter!

[12:06]
What's happening with Mr. Peanutbutter?

[12:08]
Well, I'm taking Diane and him

[12:10]
to the bank on Thursday.

[12:12]
I can use that. I can actually use that.

[12:17]
I don't know if I'm up

[12:18]
for staging a bank robbery, BoJack.

[12:20]
Oh, come on, character actress Margo Martindale.

[12:23]
They say that there are no good parts

[12:25]
for women over 50.

[12:26]
I want to stick an AK-47

[12:27]
in your hand and prove them wrong.

[12:29]
I do tire of the limitations

[12:31]
of stage, film, and television.

[12:33]
You might as well perform in a cage, am I right?

[12:34]
This is guerilla theater--

[12:36]
No stage, no script, no net.

[12:38]
It's the kind of work we talked about

[12:40]
doing that night in the desert.

[12:42]
Don't tell me we left those dreams in the sweat lodge.

[12:44]
- Hell, I'll do it. - [dishes clatter]

[12:48]
And that little boy never found his mother.

[12:50]
Hey, guys.

[12:51]
BoJack Horseman?

[12:53]
Oh. Hi.

[12:54]
What a weird coincidence.

[12:55]
I did not know you would be here today.

[12:57]
How are... things?

[12:59]
Things are good. You?

[13:01]
Things good with you?

[13:02]
Hands behind your head, everybody.

[13:03]
Nobody moves, nobody gets shot.

[13:06]
- [gasps] - What an unfortunate surprise.

[13:08]
Well, well, isn't that a pretty ring?

[13:10]
- [gasps] - [coughs] This one.

[13:12]
Well, well, isn't that a pretty ring?

[13:14]
I'll take it.

[13:15]
But it's my engagement ring.

[13:17]
Give it to her, Diane.

[13:18]
- It's just a ring. - Just a ring?

[13:20]
That ring is a symbol of your love.

[13:22]
If you don't care about the ring,

[13:24]
it really makes me wonder if you care about

[13:26]
the woman wearing it.

[13:28]
That terrifying bank robber

[13:29]
is making some very cogent points.

[13:31]
No, Mr. Peanutbutter's right.

[13:33]
If the ring is just a symbol for love,

[13:35]
why would I need a symbol

[13:36]
when I have the real thing right here?

[13:38]
Yeah, we don't need rings, we have each other.

[13:40]
Hey, why are we even waiting a month to get married?

[13:43]
If anything, this bank robbery is reminding me

[13:45]
that life is short.

[13:47]
We should get married even sooner!

[13:49]
[softly] No...

[13:50]
What do you mean sooner?

[13:51]
Why not this weekend?

[13:52]
We could get married Saturday.

[13:54]
Am I crazy?

[13:55]
[softly] Yes. Don't do it.

[13:57]
- Oh, keep the damn thing. - Aw.

[14:00]
[applause]

[14:01]
Okay. Saturday it is.

[14:03]
What the hell just happened?

[14:04]
Something truly beauti--

[14:06]
Aah!

[14:07]
- Oh. - Get your hands off me!

[14:09]
- [Taser crackles] - Uh-oh.

[14:10]
[landing blows]

[14:13]
[laughs] Long story short,

[14:15]
Erica did have to lose the foot,

[14:16]
but she gained a friend.

[14:19]
Sorry, kind of went off on a tangent there.

[14:21]
Diane and I wanna thank you all

[14:22]
for coming to our impromptu rehearsal dinner,

[14:24]
even though we did not actually have time

[14:26]
- to organize a rehearsal. - Or a dinner.

[14:29]
But there is an open bar...

[14:31]
[cheers and applause]

[14:32]
which you are all welcome to partake in

[14:34]
as soon as I finish this toast,

[14:36]
which I will be doing right...

[14:39]
after one more quick anecdote.

[14:41]
- [guests groan] - It was winter in Prague,

[14:42]
and the consumption hung low in the air.

[14:44]
Well, the bank thing was a dud.

[14:45]
Thanks a lot, Todd.

[14:46]
Well, you win some, you lose some.

[14:48]
It's like Vincent always says--

[14:49]
- "Oopsy." - Vincent?

[14:51]
Yeah, Princess Carolyn's boyfriend.

[14:52]
We've hung out a couple times.

[14:54]
- What are you ta-- - That dude is funny.

[14:56]
You know he's not a person, right?

[14:57]
Look, I don't want to get

[14:59]
in the middle of your whole thing

[15:00]
with Princess Carolyn.

[15:01]
It's not about that.

[15:02]
I just don't understand why nobody else

[15:04]
seems to notice that she is dating a man

[15:05]
who is clearly three little boys

[15:07]
doing the thing from The Little Rascals.

[15:09]
Oh, that reminds me of another funny story.

[15:11]
[clinks glass] If I could say a few words?

[15:13]
BoJack Horseman. Take the mic.

[15:15]
Spin us a yarn.

[15:16]
Mr. Peanutbutter, Diane.

[15:18]
Since I am friends with both of you

[15:20]
- and have no ulterior motives... - Mm-hmm.

[15:22]
I would like to offer my restaurant

[15:23]
as a venue for your wedding.

[15:24]
Wow! Really?

[15:26]
I don't know. That's too generous.

[15:28]
Hey, don't look a horse's gift in the mouth, right?

[15:31]
[laughter]

[15:32]
I get it. Like the song.

[15:35]
That's not a song.

[15:36]
All right, everyone.

[15:37]
That's it for the toasts.

[15:38]
Enjoy yourselves and each other.

[15:41]
[dance music plays]

[15:43]
This is perfect.

[15:45]
Now that the wedding's at my restaurant,

[15:46]
we have the home field advantage.

[15:48]
Perfect for sabotage.

[15:50]
BoJack, I need to thank you.

[15:52]
You calling me to the bar the other night

[15:54]
turned out to be the best thing

[15:56]
that ever happened to me.

[15:57]
- I think I'm in love. - Okay.

[15:58]
This "person" you're in love with--

[16:00]
Have you seen him without his trench coat on?

[16:02]
I don't understand why you can't be happy for me.

[16:03]
He's a good boyfriend.

[16:05]
I actually think you and Vincent

[16:07]
would really hit it off if you gave him a chance.

[16:09]
You should spend some one-on-one time with him.

[16:11]
You mean one-on-three time?

[16:12]
Because there are three of him.

[16:14]
We get it. You don't like him.

[16:16]
I'm actually not sure you do get it.

[16:19]
- [unzips] - I know what's been going on.

[16:21]
Ah! I wasn't gonna pee.

[16:22]
I was just taking my penis out.

[16:24]
You've been driving me around,

[16:25]
but there was something else happening the whole time.

[16:27]
I see it now.

[16:29]
What are you talking about?

[16:30]
You weren't just working as my driver, Todd.

[16:33]
You were becoming my friend.

[16:36]
Oh, yeah. That was happening.

[16:38]
Well, I could use a friend right about now.

[16:40]
There's something I really gotta get off my chest,

[16:42]
and if it got out, it could destroy the whole wedding.

[16:46]
No, I'm not great with sensitive information.

[16:49]
I don't know if I'm ready to get married again.

[16:51]
Don't get me wrong. I love Diane so much.

[16:54]
I didn't have any doubts

[16:55]
until I realized she had doubts.

[16:57]
Then I figured she's smarter than I am.

[16:59]
Maybe she knows things I don't.

[17:01]
You are kind of unloading

[17:02]
a lot of sensitive information here.

[17:04]
Sure, I think I'm ready to commit to Diane,

[17:06]
but I can't even commit to my favorite type of stick.

[17:09]
Yes, today, it's short and knobby, but tomorrow?

[17:12]
Well, sure, Diane is short, but I don't know about knobby.

[17:15]
The last thing I want to do is hurt Diane,

[17:17]
but I keep having this dream where she's gone.

[17:19]
There's no break-up, no tragedy.

[17:21]
She's just gone, and my life continues without her.

[17:23]
And it terrifies me to say this,

[17:25]
but in the dream I feel... relief.

[17:28]
Hey, thanks for listening to all this.

[17:30]
You're a really good friend, Todd.

[17:32]
[groans]

[17:34]
Since you weren't able to give me any useful intel,

[17:36]
I had to offer up my restaurant,

[17:38]
but now, we're on my turf.

[17:40]
Time for operation "I don't."

[17:42]
Yeah, sounds good.

[17:44]
You know, with my knack

[17:46]
for coming up with plans and your ability

[17:48]
to hear them without contributing

[17:49]
more than three words at a time,

[17:51]
we make a pretty good team, don't we, Todd?

[17:53]
- You said it. - See?

[17:55]
[news theme playing]

[17:56]
[newsman] Beloved character actress Margo Martindale

[17:59]
is in police custody tonight

[18:00]
for her role in a failed bank robbery.

[18:02]
Margo Martindale?

[18:04]
But first, pizza for breakfast?

[18:06]
The answer might surprise you.

[18:08]
I know her, but how? Wait.

[18:13]
She was at the convenience store

[18:14]
the night I bought that video game

[18:16]
and ruined my rock opera.

[18:18]
She's the one who asked me

[18:20]
to hand her that tape from the 10¢ bin.

[18:23]
[gasps] That means Margo Martindale likes tapes!

[18:27]
And a tape is something you listen to,

[18:29]
but tape is also a sticky thing

[18:31]
you can use to seal boxes.

[18:33]
Boxes is what cereal comes in.

[18:37]
What does it all mean?

[18:38]
Am I just grasping at straws?

[18:40]
Wait. Straws-- That's it.

[18:43]
Straws are used to drink soda or water,

[18:47]
and plants need water.

[18:49]
And BoJack used Margo Martindale as a plant

[18:53]
at the bank and the convenience store,

[18:58]
which means-- Ugh!

[19:00]
BoJack hired Margo Martindale

[19:03]
to make me find that video game

[19:05]
so he could kill my rock opera!

[19:10]
Aw, dude.

[19:14]
- Rise and shine, Todd. - I didn't sleep.

[19:17]
Well, we're down to the wire, but we still got

[19:19]
one more day to figure out how to stop this wedding,

[19:21]
and I can't afford to waste one second, so let's get--

[19:23]
Oh, shit. Forgot about jury duty.

[19:25]
Damn you, Tuesday BoJack.

[19:31]
- And so, you saw the defendant. - Yes.

[19:35]
That man, the defendant-- You saw him?

[19:39]
Come on, come on, come on. Hurry up.

[19:40]
- That's correct. - The defendant was seen by you.

[19:44]
Sweet Jesus.

[19:46]
Some of us have weddings to ruin.

[19:47]
Yes.

[19:48]
No further questions, Your Honor.

[19:50]
I'm sorry. I misspoke.

[19:52]
A lot of further questions.

[19:54]
[groans]

[20:01]
The jury finds the defendant not guilty on all charges.

[20:04]
[murmuring]

[20:05]
We did the right thing today, BoJack.

[20:07]
But you know who the real winner is?

[20:09]
- Justice. - Mr. Peanutbutter.

[20:13]
[sighs]

[20:14]
BoJack.

[20:15]
There's my superstar.

[20:17]
- How are you? - Amazing!

[20:19]
This has been the role of a lifetime.

[20:21]
I think they're gonna send me up to Lompoc,

[20:23]
and when I get there, I'm gonna find

[20:26]
the meanest, hardest queen bitch of the yard,

[20:28]
and I'm going to bite her finger off.

[20:31]
[laughs] That'll show everyone I'm crazy,

[20:33]
and you don't mess with crazy.

[20:35]
Plus, free finger.

[20:36]
Oh, here I am blabbering on about my plans.

[20:39]
Did you ever stop that wedding?

[20:41]
It's actually happening right now.

[20:42]
I ran out of time.

[20:44]
I never understood why

[20:45]
it was so important to keep those two apart.

[20:47]
I was just trying to be a good friend

[20:49]
in my own shitty, ass-backwards way.

[20:52]
Diane deserves the best.

[20:53]
She's smart and kind and beautiful,

[20:55]
and it's gonna be mostly synonyms from here on

[20:58]
if I keep going,

[20:59]
and I'm in love with her.

[21:01]
Tell her that, BoJack.

[21:03]
You don't need kooky schemes or nutty capers.

[21:06]
Just go to her and speak from your heart.

[21:09]
Then find the biggest person at the wedding

[21:12]
and bite his finger off!

[21:14]
You're right, partly.

[21:16]
I've gotta tell her how I feel.

[21:18]
Okay, I'm gonna do it.

[21:20]
Good luck with your finger thing.

[21:21]
[tires screech]

[21:24]
[car alarm chirps]

[21:25]
Todd, thank God you're here!

[21:26]
Did I miss it? Is it too late?

[21:28]
Dude. I'm done with this. No. No.

[21:29]
Mr. Peanutbutter's been nice to me.

[21:31]
Mr. Peanutbutter is nice to everybody.

[21:32]
That's what makes him so stupid.

[21:34]
No, I'm stupid.

[21:36]
But even I know that the only reason

[21:38]
you're doing this is because you're in love with Diane.

[21:41]
Yes, that's right.

[21:42]
And I'm here to finally tell her how I feel.

[21:44]
BoJack, she knows how you feel.

[21:46]
How? I barely just realized--

[21:48]
Hey, man, she made her choice.

[21:50]
Look around. This day is not about you, okay?

[21:55]
So maybe you should just stop trying

[21:57]
to mess with other people's lives.

[22:00]
[Diane] I never thought I wanted to get married.

[22:03]
It's so weird,

[22:05]
this idea of dedicating yourself to something

[22:07]
for the rest of your life.

[22:08]
Like, how could you know, right?

[22:10]
But then I realized it's okay to not know everything.

[22:14]
And some things take a leap of faith.

[22:16]
Mr. Peanutbutter, I want to take that leap with you.

[22:19]
By the power vested in me by one of those dumb websites,

[22:22]
I now pronounce you married.

[22:24]
Go ahead. Kiss, you lovesick dummies.

[22:26]
[kissing]

Hey, Todd. Todd.

[22:41]
Thanks for hearing me out the other night.

[22:42]
I'm really glad I went through with this.

[22:44]
This is the happiest day of my life.

[22:46]
Always happy to be of service.

[22:47]
Oh, and, um, I got you something.

[22:49]
Todd Chavez?

[22:51]
Hey. That name's my name.

[22:53]
What's "PB Livin'"?

[22:54]
My film production company. Read your title.

[22:58]
"Executive Vice President of West Coast Operations."

[23:02]
Whoa! Does that mean I control the waves?

[23:05]
No, it means you're my assistant.

[23:07]
You've got a big future ahead of you,

[23:09]
and I don't want you to waste any time looking back.

[23:11]
So I got all my cars' mirrors taken off.

[23:13]
Isn't that kind of dangerous?

[23:15]
What do I care? I'm not driving.

[23:17]
Hey, BoJack. Thanks for coming.

[23:20]
I wasn't sure you were gonna make it.

[23:22]
Wouldn't have missed it for the world.

[23:24]
You're a good friend. I'm really glad to know you.

[23:26]
- Mwah. - Sorry that I--

[23:29]
If I made things weird.

[23:30]
They weren't that weird.

[23:32]
- Oh. - [Mr. Peanutbutter] Diane, honey?

[23:33]
Oh, I gotta go dance with my husband.

[23:36]
[squeals]

[23:37]
I'm married! [giggles]

[23:40]
Hi.

[23:42]
So you're the quote-unquote person, singular,

[23:45]
that everyone's so crazy about.

[23:47]
What have you got figured out that I don't?

[23:48]
Um, adult stuff.

[23:51]
Yeah, I'm not seeing it.

[23:53]
But that doesn't matter. Not everything's about me.

[23:55]
And maybe I am a little jealous.

[23:57]
Not because I actually want to date Princess Carolyn anymore,

[24:00]
but just because I don't like the idea that I can't.

[24:04]
I guess I just assumed I always could.

[24:06]
But I made a lot of bad decisions.

[24:08]
Not just with her. With... [sighs]

[24:11]
with everyone, really.

[24:13]
You know, Princess Carolyn was right.

[24:16]
- You are a good listener. - Thanks.

[24:18]
You know, sometimes I feel like I was born with a leak,

[24:21]
and any goodness I started with just slowly

[24:23]
spilled out of me, and now it's all gone.

[24:25]
And I'll never get it back in me.

[24:27]
It's too late.

[24:29]
Life is a series of closing doors, isn't it?

[24:34]
Don't be sad.
