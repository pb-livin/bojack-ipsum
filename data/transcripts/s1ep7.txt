[00:05]
You got to get your shit together.

[00:08]
So you took some licks, but you're gonna bounce back,

[00:11]
because you're talented, you're smart,

[00:13]
and damn it, you're good.

[00:15]
You are a goddamn American treasure, you know that?

[00:17]
You are BoJack goddamn Horseman.

[00:21]
So get the hell off my lawn.

[00:23]
Oh.

[00:24]
Here I thought I was at the drive-through at Carl's Jr.

[00:27]
How much did I have to drink last night?

[00:29]
Last night? Oh, you've been on a bender

[00:31]
for the last two weeks, ever since you found out Diane

[00:33]
got engaged to Mr. Peanutbutter.

[00:35]
Diane got engaged to Mr. Peanutbutter?

[00:37]
- I need a drink. - No. No more drinking.

[00:39]
You've been out of control.

[00:41]
Princess Carolyn, look. I met John Stamos.

[00:44]
That is not John Stamos.

[00:46]
Hey, Princess Carolyn,

[00:48]
John Stamos and I got our ears pierced.

[00:50]
That is not your ear.

[00:52]
Princess Carolyn, John Stamos died.

[00:55]
Why? Why, God?

[00:57]
Why did you take John Stamos?

[01:00]
That doesn't sound so bad.

[01:02]
Oh, I forgot to mention you were naked for a lot of that.

[01:04]
Stamos!

[01:08]
Also, it wasn't here. It was at my office.

[01:10]
We thought night swimming would be fun,

[01:12]
but the current was too strong.

[01:15]
Oh, God, I wasn't driving around, was I?

[01:17]
No. You made Todd your designated driver,

[01:19]
but then you also made him drink with you.

[01:22]
Yeah, I'll have a western bacon cheeseburger.

[01:25]
BoJack, we are going to get you back on your feet.

[01:27]
All you need to do is get off Diane

[01:29]
and get on to something else.

[01:31]
- [line rings] - Hello?

[01:32]
Tony, hi. I'm calling in that favor.

[01:34]
Get your crew to BoJack Horseman's house.

[01:36]
Can you be there in an hour?

[01:37]
- Yeah. - Great.

[01:39]
What just happened?

[01:40]
You're the new face of Guten Bourbon.

[01:42]
What is Guten Bourbon?

[01:43]
It's an urban German bourbon.

[01:44]
Am I just hungover, or are you talking like a Muppet?

[01:47]
They're looking for American celebrities

[01:49]
to talk about how much they like to drink.

[01:50]
It's the part you were born to play.

[01:52]
All you have to do is smile and stay upright.

[01:55]
I don't know. It sounds like a lot of work.

[01:57]
You take up 80% of my time with your drama

[01:59]
and make me 0% of my money.

[02:01]
Do the damn commercial.

[02:03]
[cell phone vibrates]

[02:04]
7:00 a.m. Breakfast with Lenny Turteltaub.

[02:07]
Okay, I got to go. You're in charge, Todd.

[02:09]
Keep this dummy out of trouble.

[02:11]
Hooray, responsibility.

[02:13]
- [vomits] - Hey.

[02:15]
Do you really believe all that stuff you said to me earlier

[02:18]
about me being smart and talented and good?

[02:21]
BoJack, I'm an agent. I believe everything I say.

[02:25]
Ah.

[02:27]
Hey, where the hell is that cheeseburger?

[02:29]
I ordered it, like, an hour ago.

[02:31]
[funky electronic music]

[02:34]
♪ ♪

[03:27]
Lenny Turteltaub, you skinny bitch.

[03:29]
How the hell are you?

[03:31]
I'm in a hurry, so I'll make this... snappy.

[03:34]
I got some great news about the picture

[03:36]
we're putting together.

[03:37]
- [cell phone rings] - Sorry. Hello?

[03:39]
Hey, I just wanted to thank you for getting me this job

[03:42]
and pulling me out of that oh-so-predictably BoJack

[03:46]
spiral of self-loathing and substance abuse.

[03:48]
- You really are the best. - I know. Talk to you later.

[03:50]
I feel like you see things in me that nobody else sees.

[03:53]
Yep, I'm pretty great. Got to go.

[03:54]
All this time, I never even--

[03:56]
BoJack, I'm in a very important breakfast right now.

[03:58]
- Okay. I got to go, too. - Sorry.

[04:00]
What's the great news?

[04:01]
- We got Braff. - You beautiful dickhead.

[04:05]
You finally got Zach Braff?

[04:07]
Ah, no other director has enough weight

[04:09]
to handle a movie about the last days of Eva Braun.

[04:12]
No shit, toots.

[04:13]
Ooh, ooh, ooh. There you go.

[04:15]
Thank you, sweetheart.

[04:17]
Everything's coming together.

[04:18]
With Braff directing,

[04:19]
my client Cate Blanchett starring,

[04:21]
and the great Lenny Turteltaub producing,

[04:23]
this movie is a done deal.

[04:25]
Look, honey, I been in this business a long time, okay?

[04:27]
Long time.

[04:28]
And as I once said to a young Ed Begley Sr.,

[04:31]
"It ain't a done deal till the deals are all done."

[04:33]
I'm the best agent in the biz.

[04:35]
I can seal these deals with my paws in my pants.

[04:38]
Well, then I'll say to you what I once said

[04:39]
to a young Buster Keaton, "What?"

[04:42]
[jazzy music]

[04:48]
[overlapping shouting]

[04:52]
Laura! What's happening?

[04:55]
- We're merging. - No shit. With what?

[04:57]
FME. A bunch of people got laid off,

[04:59]
and some of the FMEers are already moving in.

[05:01]
It's all so sudden and unexpected.

[05:03]
- It was not handled well. - [laughter]

[05:07]
Oh, shit. Don't tell me one of the new agents is...

[05:10]
Vanessa Gekko.

[05:11]
That slippery, slimy, cold-blooded, bug-eyed--

[05:14]
What's new, pussycat?

[05:16]
- Gekko. - In the flesh.

[05:18]
Ha ha. How are you?

[05:20]
What a morning, huh?

[05:22]
I was in the middle of my second soul cycle class

[05:24]
when I got the news.

[05:25]
- Can you imagine? - No.

[05:27]
I was so excited, I rushed home,

[05:29]
made love to my husband of 15 years,

[05:31]
made a hot breakfast for my three wonderful girls,

[05:34]
read to them, dropped them off at their elite private school,

[05:37]
and then got my ass here as quick as I could.

[05:39]
- Um, how old are your kids now? - I don't have any children.

[05:42]
Oh, well, it'll happen. You're still...

[05:46]
- Anyway-- - Princess Carolyn.

[05:48]
I see you've already met a new member of the team.

[05:52]
- Vanessa Gekko, sir. - I know that.

[05:54]
This merger is very exciting.

[05:57]
- I'm pumped. - I'm beyond pumped.

[05:58]
You should be, or at least I think you should be.

[06:01]
It's hard to keep track of who's getting promoted

[06:04]
- and who's getting fired. - Oh.

[06:06]
You're probably fine or not. Who knows?

[06:09]
[cell phone rings]

[06:11]
Ugh. What do you want, Todd?

[06:13]
Well, good news, bad news.

[06:15]
The bad news is that there actually is no good news,

[06:18]
and the other bad news is BoJack's gone.

[06:21]
What? Where did he go? The shoot is at his house.

[06:23]
He just disappeared. I don't even know why he'd leave.

[06:26]
This charcoal mellowed bourbon is so smooth,

[06:28]
every time I take a sip, pure happiness.

[06:32]
- That was amazing. - Really?

[06:33]
Can I get you to say that in a tuxedo?

[06:35]
Hey, I got to go. I think this is my big break.

[06:37]
Don't worry. I won't let it get to my head or anything.

[06:40]
Hey, who told that asshole he could sit in my chair?

[06:43]
Don't forget I'm your agent, too! I want 10%.

[06:46]
Hello, beautiful.

[06:47]
What the hell are you doing here?

[06:49]
You're supposed to be shooting a commercial.

[06:51]
I know, but I was sitting there drinking bourbon and--

[06:53]
They didn't give you fake bourbon on set?

[06:54]
Oh, they did, and then I just mixed it with bourbon.

[06:56]
And it hit me.

[06:58]
Why was I so upset about Diane getting engaged?

[07:00]
You're the one who's always been there for me,

[07:02]
so I drank a lot more bourbon

[07:03]
and drove over to tell you how I feel.

[07:05]
Oh, I see what this is.

[07:07]
Princess Carolyn, what are we doing?

[07:10]
Clearly we're in love with each other.

[07:12]
You're not in love with me. You're in love with Diane.

[07:14]
And you're not even really in love with her.

[07:16]
You just think you are because you pay her

[07:17]
to listen to you talk about yourself.

[07:19]
Diane getting engaged was the best thing

[07:20]
that ever happened to me.

[07:21]
It made me realize you're the one I need to be with.

[07:24]
Ha! You say that every time something bad happens.

[07:28]
Not getting nominated for a People's Choice Award

[07:29]
is the best thing that ever happened to me.

[07:31]
It made me realize--

[07:33]
Getting caught with that pound of cocaine

[07:34]
was the best thing that ever happened to me.

[07:36]
That hooker getting pregnant

[07:38]
was the best thing that ever happened to me.

[07:39]
Sneezing on Marisa Tomei was the best--

[07:41]
Every time something bad happens,

[07:43]
you come running to me for comfort.

[07:45]
Well, it's not gonna happen this time.

[07:47]
I can't be your agent and your girlfriend.

[07:49]
- It just doesn't work. - [knock on door]

[07:51]
I have Lenny Turteltaub for you.

[07:53]
- I have to take this. - Okay.

[07:54]
But remember, I'm coming for you,

[07:57]
and I'm gonna make you love me.

[08:00]
Please don't. Hey.

[08:02]
Bad news, P.C.

[08:03]
Braff used your merger as an opportunity to jump ship.

[08:05]
Aw, fish.

[08:06]
Now his new agent's asking for twice the money.

[08:09]
As I once said to a young Lionel Barrymore,

[08:11]
"Eh, shut up."

[08:13]
Without a director, Eva Braun is as dead as Eva Braun.

[08:16]
Yep. You got to get someone big.

[08:18]
- What about those brothers-- - Hello? Hello?

[08:20]
Lady, you work too hard.

[08:22]
That was an important phone call.

[08:24]
Important phone call beep boop blorp.

[08:26]
Don't you robot-voice me.

[08:27]
Princess Carolyn, what are we doing?

[08:30]
Well, I'm working, and you are leaving.

[08:32]
Before I go, I got you a little sexy something

[08:35]
to remember me by.

[08:36]
Since we can't be together every second,

[08:38]
which would be my preference, I give you cardboard BoJack.

[08:42]
It's got a light-sensitive sound chip,

[08:43]
so every time you walk by it,

[08:44]
it quotes a line from Jerry Maguire,

[08:46]
your favorite movie.

[08:47]
You complete me.

[08:48]
What do you think? Pretty sweet, huh?

[08:50]
You had me at "hello."

[08:51]
I don't have time for you or cardboard you.

[08:53]
I need to find a new director.

[08:55]
Or you could find my nude erector--

[08:58]
She's gone.

[08:59]
[jazzy music]

[09:02]
[elevator bell dings]

[09:03]
Blech. Word to the wise, Laura--

[09:06]
Do not pitch a Nazi romance to Steven Spielberg.

[09:08]
Just thought you should know

[09:10]
there's been some reorganization

[09:11]
- vis-a-vis resource management. - What are you saying?

[09:13]
You and Vanessa Gekko are sharing an office

[09:15]
until they can find her a permanent one.

[09:17]
- The hell we are. - Also...

[09:19]
Good news, Princess Carolyn. Vanessa's my agent now.

[09:21]
What?

[09:22]
You said you couldn't be my girlfriend and my agent,

[09:24]
so I'm firing you.

[09:26]
Now we can be in love.

[09:28]
- Hope you like money, BoJack. - This is so great.

[09:31]
Now I can date you and have a better agent.

[09:33]
- Everybody wins. - Oh.

[09:35]
I'm a sporting agent.

[09:36]
Are you still searching for happiness?

[09:40]
Make your own happiness.

[09:42]
Mmm, that's some Guten Bourbon.

[09:46]
Cut. That was great.

[09:47]
Was it? You know, I'm trying to do good work here,

[09:50]
really find the character, but it's pretty distracting

[09:53]
to have all these robots

[09:54]
staring at me with their blinking red eyes.

[09:56]
Those are cameras, Todd. We're making a commercial.

[09:59]
Oh, well, you want to make a good one?

[10:01]
Then get them the hell out of here!

[10:03]
I'm the face of this brand, I'm the man behind the thing,

[10:07]
and I'm determined to get the jargon

[10:09]
of this German bourbon blurbin'.

[10:13]
Is it just me, or does this fake booze

[10:14]
taste a lot like real booze?

[10:17]
You want BoJack, you can have him.

[10:19]
Here's a list of directors who won't work with him,

[10:21]
studios that won't hire him,

[10:23]
former assistants with restraining orders.

[10:24]
This is great.

[10:25]
You know, it gets kind of boring

[10:27]
when all your clients are in such demand,

[10:29]
they practically find their own jobs.

[10:31]
Well, then BoJack should be a lot of fun for you.

[10:33]
- No one wants to hire him. - [knock on door]

[10:36]
Hello. We're looking for BoJack Horseman's agent.

[10:39]
We'd like to discuss

[10:41]
a very lucrative business opportunity.

[10:43]
- You gotta be kidding me. - I'm BoJack's agent.

[10:46]
The opportunity is we're blackmailing you.

[10:49]
Ha. All yours.

[10:51]
Needless to say,

[10:52]
it would be a shame if these pictures got out.

[10:55]
Fortunately, that can easily be avoided

[10:57]
by simply paying me and my partner here $150.

[11:03]
Each.

[11:04]
Let me just get my checkbook.

[11:06]
Huh?

[11:07]
- Whoa. - [chuckles]

[11:08]
Oh, except California law prohibits taking photos

[11:11]
on private property without a permit,

[11:13]
but you had a permit, right?

[11:14]
- Uh... - What's that?

[11:16]
Oh, also, extortion can be prosecuted

[11:17]
as a class E felony.

[11:18]
That's four years in prison, easy,

[11:20]
and when you throw in the murder of Tupac Shakur...

[11:22]
- We didn't do that. - Yeah, yeah.

[11:23]
You can't pin that on us.

[11:24]
Well, someone's got to take the fall.

[11:26]
- [both gulp] - Sorry to bother you.

[11:28]
Forget we were ever here.

[11:33]
That was fun.

[11:35]
Hey, Laura, send those guys a nice fruit-and-nut basket.

[11:37]
You got it, boss.

[11:39]
Who said you could use my assistant?

[11:40]
- I did. - Oh, hello, Mr. Witherspoon.

[11:43]
Did you know the human head weighs 8 pounds?

[11:45]
Fascinating.

[11:46]
So sorry we have to double up on everything

[11:49]
while we work out who goes where and who gets fired,

[11:52]
but in the meantime, help yourself to an intern,

[11:55]
one of the rising stars at our company--

[11:58]
- Charlie Witherspoon. - Hello. I-- Oh.

[12:02]
Sorry, my-- My hands are really sticky.

[12:05]
[groans]

[12:07]
Oh, God, am I blowing this?

[12:10]
[glass shatters]

[12:12]
Charlie was the editor of The Harvard Lampoon.

[12:15]
He can be Princess Carolyn's new assistant

[12:16]
while I use Laura.

[12:17]
- Ugh. - Good thinking, boss.

[12:18]
[phone rings]

[12:20]
Ah, ah, phone is ringing. Phone is ringing.

[12:23]
What do I do? What do I do?

[12:24]
I'll take it in here, Charlie. Hello.

[12:27]
Princess Carolyn, your client is out of control.

[12:29]
BoJack is not my client anymore.

[12:32]
Not BoJack. Todd.

[12:33]
I think someone mixed alcohol into his prop drink.

[12:36]
Oh, you pretenders.

[12:37]
Bourbon is the name of a county.

[12:39]
You can't just make bourbon in Germany.

[12:42]
That would be like making Rice-A-Roni

[12:44]
- anywhere but San Francisco. - No, no, no, no, no.

[12:47]
- Ugh. I'll be right there. - Ow.

[12:50]
You got to get your shit together.

[12:52]
You are a winner, okay? You are Todd-- Hold on.

[12:55]
4:30 p.m. Meeting with Eva Braun team.

[12:59]
Fish. Okay, you are Todd goddamn--

[13:02]
- What's your last name? - Chavez.

[13:04]
- Your last name is Chavez? - Yeah. Why?

[13:06]
I don't know, I just never thought of you

[13:07]
as a Chavez. Look, I got to go.

[13:09]
I feel like you didn't really finish the pep talk.

[13:11]
I know, but I got a movie to put together.

[13:13]
Best of luck.

[13:14]
Ready for the tagline? Here's the tagline.

[13:17]
What the heck is going on?

[13:18]
"The woman who loved the man who hated everyone."

[13:21]
- That writes itself. - You got to be kidding me.

[13:23]
Hey, where were you? We looked everywhere.

[13:26]
You're having the Eva Braun meeting without me?

[13:29]
I'm so sorry,

[13:30]
but I didn't know what the protocol was around here,

[13:33]
and these guys were just champing at the bit.

[13:35]
- We're just wrapping up. - But Cate is my client.

[13:37]
Okay, why don't I come find you when it's over,

[13:39]
and I'll bring you up to speed?

[13:40]
Is that Quentin Tarantulino?

[13:42]
Yeah. I brought him on board.

[13:44]
You know he's always wanted to direct a romantic comedy?

[13:46]
Eva Braun is not a romantic comedy.

[13:49]
[sing-song] Bye.

[13:50]
[dramatic music]

[13:52]
We live in a cynical world, a cynical world.

[13:56]
He's right, you know.

[13:58]
Oh, ooh, oh, oh, over-rotate. Hey.

[14:02]
I just missed an important meeting

[14:03]
because I was babysitting Todd, who's too drunk to work,

[14:06]
because you switched out the prop bourbon

[14:08]
with the real bourbon. You are ruining my life.

[14:11]
- Have dinner with me tonight. - No way.

[14:13]
Come on, just me, you, and a bottle of Pinot.

[14:17]
Probably more than one bottle and some entrees.

[14:18]
And I'll probably get an appetizer.

[14:20]
I own the restaurant, so we can go crazy.

[14:22]
- I have to work. - You don't have to work.

[14:24]
- You choose to work. - Hmm.

[14:28]
Why not choose to be happy for once?

[14:30]
Mm.

[14:32]
[soft piano music]

[14:35]
When you're writing a memoir,

[14:36]
you spend a lot of time reflecting on the past.

[14:39]
I regret not being a better friend to you

[14:42]
and lover.

[14:44]
Thank you.

[14:45]
Lover's kind of a weird word,

[14:46]
but thanks.

[14:48]
You want to get out of this stuffy old restaurant,

[14:50]
get some gelato, and maybe drive out to the ocean

[14:53]
- and put our feet in the water? - That sounds great.

[14:56]
Let me just freshen up my whiskers.

[14:58]
Great. I'll get the car and meet you outside.

[15:00]
You scamper right back, pussycat.

[15:02]
You look at your reflection too long,

[15:03]
you might fall in love. She's gone.

[15:05]
[cell phone rings]

[15:07]
What do you want, Gekko?

[15:09]
Well, I was hoping to talk to you face-to-face,

[15:11]
but I guess you had to leave work early.

[15:13]
I left at 8:30. What is it?

[15:15]
Well, Cate and I had a really good talk today.

[15:18]
We have so much in common,

[15:20]
and especially since I'm doing so much for Eva Braun,

[15:22]
it almost seemed weird that I wasn't repping her.

[15:25]
No. No. No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

[15:27]
She and I are both high-powered working mothers,

[15:30]
so I understand her priorities,

[15:32]
so she's switching to Gekko.

[15:34]
Wow, being a mom helped my career?

[15:37]
I really can have it all.

[15:39]
This isn't fair. I know everything about Cate.

[15:41]
Her favorite color is red.

[15:43]
Her favorite book is Suffragette City.

[15:45]
Her favorite Spice Girl is Baby.

[15:46]
I know all I need to know,

[15:48]
which is that she's beautiful, she's British,

[15:50]
and she's gonna make me a lot of money.

[15:51]
She's Australian, you moron.

[15:53]
If you need me, I'll be at work.

[15:55]
[sing-song] Bye.

[15:56]
[sing-song] Bye.

[15:58]
Ugh.

[16:00]
[phone rings]

[16:02]
Uh, telephone.

[16:04]
Charlie, get me Cate Blanchett.

[16:05]
Um, who is-- Okay, I don't--

[16:09]
Uh, uh, sorry, I can't--

[16:12]
Oh, sticky.

[16:14]
You know what? Never mind.

[16:16]
If Vanessa Gekko wants Cate that bad, she can have her.

[16:19]
I'm gonna be okay. I'm gonna be happy.

[16:22]
Tonight, I choose to be happy.

[16:26]
Hello? I think I put you on mute.

[16:28]
Good night, Charlie.

[16:33]
[ringtone jingles]

[16:35]
Holy shit.

[16:38]
Herb! How the hell are you, buddy?

[16:42]
Ruin any lives lately?

[16:43]
- Excuse me? - I got your message, asshole.

[16:46]
[coughs]

[16:47]
You got something to say to me,

[16:49]
you come out to Malibu and say it to my face.

[16:51]
I'll be alive tomorrow. After that, who knows?

[16:55]
[beeps off]

[16:57]
[sighs]

[16:58]
Sorry that took me so long.

[17:00]
Just wanted to look my best for you, lover.

[17:03]
Hey, um, I just got kind of a weird phone call.

[17:08]
You and me both. Hey, screw 'em all, right?

[17:12]
Yeah.

[17:14]
Are we going to gelato?

[17:16]
Princess Carolyn, what are we doing?

[17:18]
Getting gelato?

[17:20]
[sighs]

[17:22]
This was a mistake. I've been acting crazy.

[17:26]
That phone call just pulled me back to reality.

[17:29]
You were right. I don't love you.

[17:31]
You don't love me. We're just two lonely people

[17:33]
trying to hate ourselves a little less.

[17:36]
Maybe that's all we're ever gonna be.

[17:38]
Maybe that's all we ever were.

[17:41]
Well, this night took a turn.

[17:46]
You know the worst part? I knew this was gonna happen

[17:49]
and I let myself get excited anyway.

[17:52]
So we agree that this is on you, then?

[18:00]
I guess I'll see you around.

[18:01]
You're not even gonna give me a ride home?

[18:04]
Sorry, I think I just need to be alone right now.

[18:07]
[tires squealing]

[18:09]
[sighs]

[18:10]
Of course, of course.

[18:12]
That's what you get when you fall for a horse.

[18:15]
Taxi.

[18:18]
You got to get your shit together.

[18:20]
So yesterday, you let yourself fall in love a little bit,

[18:22]
and you got your heart broken.

[18:24]
Serves you right for having feelings.

[18:26]
Starting now, you are a hard, heartless career gal.

[18:29]
Go to work, be awesome at it,

[18:31]
and don't waste time on foolish flights of fancy.

[18:33]
From now on, you are a robot.

[18:35]
Beep bop boop blurp bleep.

[18:40]
[cell phone vibrates]

[18:41]
- Hello. - I just want you to know I'm fine.

[18:44]
Uh-oh. People only say they're fine when they're not fine.

[18:46]
Did I hurt your feelings last night?

[18:48]
I'm an agent. I don't have feelings.

[18:50]
Well, I'm glad you called.

[18:51]
I think that you had the right idea yesterday.

[18:53]
I should be getting back to work.

[18:54]
Can you get me another job?

[18:56]
Yeah, well, I'm not your agent anymore, so, no.

[18:58]
Oh, right. Well, just tell whoever, then.

[19:00]
- Haah! - [tires screech]

[19:02]
Whoa.

[19:03]
[honks horn]

[19:05]
Asshole!

[19:08]
Anyway, I'm off to Malibu to see Herb Kazzaz.

[19:10]
He has cancer, which, as you know, is a whole thing.

[19:12]
Plus, he hates me, so I could really use some good news

[19:15]
at the end of the day.

[19:16]
Oh, my God, you're going to see Herb?

[19:18]
You must be really--

[19:19]
Nope, don't care. Not interested.

[19:21]
[phone beeps]

[19:22]
Hope you like kicking ass, Charlie,

[19:24]
because that's all we're gonna do today.

[19:26]
My tie got stuck in the copier this morning.

[19:29]
That's great, Charlie.

[19:30]
If you flip them real quick,

[19:32]
it looks like the tie is running.

[19:34]
Hey, Vanessa, your client, BoJack Horseman, wants a job.

[19:37]
- Good luck. - Oh, yeah, about that.

[19:39]
Gwyneth came in this morning,

[19:40]
and I wanted to show her that she was a top priority,

[19:42]
so I shredded BoJack's contract

[19:44]
right in front of her. Heh heh

[19:46]
What? You just signed BoJack yesterday.

[19:48]
I say good riddance to Mr. Houseman

[19:51]
or whatever that horse's name is.

[19:53]
It's not like he makes this company any money,

[19:55]
and he does seem to take up an awful lot of your time.

[19:58]
I'm from Arizona, Jerry. I went to Arizona State.

[20:01]
Todd, how do I turn this thing off?

[20:04]
Todd.

[20:05]
[Todd] What? I'm busy.

[20:07]
[BoJack] Never mind. Think I've figured it out.

[20:10]
Now that I've got the room to myself,

[20:13]
time to practice the trombone.

[20:15]
[trombone plays]

[20:20]
He's kind of in a bad place right now.

[20:22]
You can't just drop him.

[20:24]
The best agent in this building

[20:25]
couldn't get that guy a job.

[20:27]
The best agent in this building

[20:28]
got him a job yesterday,

[20:29]
and I could get him a feature by the end of today.

[20:32]
If you want to get him a movie

[20:33]
by the end of the day, great, do that.

[20:35]
Otherwise, we are washing our hands of him.

[20:37]
Charlie, I hear NBC picked up your running tie show.

[20:41]
Congratulations.

[20:43]
[Charlie] Thank you, Dad.

[20:47]
Hey, Marty, Princess Carolyn here.

[20:50]
How'd you like to work with the BoJack Horseman?

[20:53]
What's that? You hate his guts?

[20:55]
What's that? He's a talentless boob?

[20:59]
What's that? You'll never work with BoJack again?

[21:01]
What's that?

[21:02]
You want him to die in an ass factory warehouse fire,

[21:05]
smothering to death under a pile of burning asses?

[21:08]
Well, if you change your mind, give me a call.

[21:10]
Oh, BoJack, what am I gonna do with you?

[21:12]
I don't understand

[21:13]
why you're going through all this trouble for him.

[21:15]
That guy's dead weight, Princess Carolyn.

[21:17]
If you don't cut him loose, you're never gonna be happy.

[21:20]
Help me help you.

[21:22]
That's it. Of course.

[21:25]
Cameron Crow, you skinny bitch.

[21:27]
You know Jerry Maguire's my favorite movie of all time?

[21:30]
All your films are so human,

[21:31]
which is super impressive since you're a crow.

[21:34]
Well, my name is Cameron Crow,

[21:36]
but I'm actually a raven,

[21:37]
so common misconception.

[21:39]
- Well, whatever you are-- - A raven.

[21:41]
- I brought you this - Suffragette City...

[21:43]
"a coming of age story about rock music,

[21:46]
being a teenager in the '80s and buying zoos"?

[21:50]
How have I not heard of this book?

[21:52]
You'd be the perfect director

[21:53]
to make a movie out of it,

[21:54]
and I happen to know this is

[21:56]
Cate Blanchett's favorite book.

[21:57]
I'll bet she'll drop everything to play the part.

[21:59]
You should give her a caw.

[22:01]
Okay, I see-- Yeah. Caw is what crows say.

[22:04]
Again, I am not a crow.

[22:06]
[jazzy music]

[22:10]
Cate, listen to me, you're making a big mistake.

[22:13]
Eva Braun is your dream, remember?

[22:15]
Cate? Hello?

[22:17]
Cate!

[22:19]
Oh, no. What happened?

[22:21]
Did Cate drop out of your little Holocaust movie

[22:23]
so she could make my little Cameron Crow movie?

[22:26]
Why don't you go home and cry about it

[22:28]
to your loving husband and children?

[22:30]
Say, which one of you

[22:32]
is overseeing the Eva Braun package?

[22:34]
That would be me, sir.

[22:35]
Vanessa, you really shat the bed on this one.

[22:38]
Now, are you fired? Not exactly.

[22:40]
Can you still work here? No.

[22:42]
Lenny Turteltaub here to see you.

[22:44]
Thanks, Laura.

[22:45]
So, one minute I'm making a movie with Cate Blanchett.

[22:47]
Next, I hear she's doing a picture with Cameron Crow

[22:49]
about mix tapes.

[22:51]
As I said to Ed Porter

[22:52]
at the premiere of The Great Train Robbery,

[22:54]
"Aah, the train's coming right at me."

[22:56]
- What the hell is going on? - I don't know, Lenny.

[22:58]
Eva Braun was Vanessa's project.

[23:00]
All that work for nothing.

[23:02]
Now Quentin Tarantulino's got four arms up my ass

[23:04]
'cause he got all excited about making a rom-com.

[23:06]
You know what would be a great romantic comedy?

[23:08]
Remember when that guy stole the D from the Hollywood sign

[23:10]
so he could propose to his girlfriend?

[23:12]
That would make a great movie,

[23:14]
but who would play the lead?

[23:16]
Preferably someone kind of washed up.

[23:18]
You know how much Quentin

[23:19]
loves to revitalize dead careers.

[23:20]
It's kind of his thing.

[23:22]
Well, in that case, you know who'd be great?

[23:24]
Show me the money.

[23:26]
[cell phone vibrates]

[23:29]
- Yeah. - Good news.

[23:31]
You're back in my stable,

[23:32]
and I got you the lead in a romantic comedy.

[23:35]
Who's the best agent in the world?

[23:37]
What?

[23:39]
I went through hell and back today, but it was worth it

[23:41]
because I got you a job. Aren't you excited?

[23:45]
No. I don't know.

[23:47]
I don't care about that.

[23:49]
You... You said you wanted a job.

[23:52]
It doesn't matter. Nothing matters.

[23:55]
- Wow. What happened in Malibu? - I got to go.

[23:58]
[beep]

[24:00]
Need anything else?

[24:02]
No, thanks, Laura. Go home. I'll see you tomorrow.

[24:06]
Are you gonna head out soon?

[24:07]
Where else would I go?

[24:10]
[upbeat music]

[24:19]
[cell phone vibrates]

[24:21]
Happy birthday, Princess Carolyn.

[24:24]
[sighs] Thanks, phone.

[24:27]
You are 40.
