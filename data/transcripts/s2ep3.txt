[00:08]
I'm sorry I broke your expensive bachelor vase.

[00:11]
[audience] Aww.

[00:12]
That's all right. I've learned that when you're in a loving family

[00:16]
there's nothing wrong with a little horsin' around.

[00:19]
[laughter, applause]

[00:20]
[Herb] Cut!

[00:21]
That's the show, folks.

[00:22]
Now, let's hear it for our amazing cast.

[00:25]
Joelle.

[00:26]
Bradley.

[00:27]
Little Sarah Lynn.

[00:29]
And our star, BoJack Horseman!

[00:33]
Thanks for coming out. Thank you very much.

[00:36]
-[laughing] -Wow!

[00:38]
Great pilot.

[00:39]
We got the biggest laugh I ever heard with that "gag me with a spoon" joke.

[00:42]
And then we topped it with the "get a room" joke.

[00:45]
This was so fun.

[00:47]
Do we get to make more?

[00:48]
I think we got a real shot.

[00:50]
And as long as the ratings don't dip below a dismal 15 million a night,

[00:54]
we could be on the air for many years.

[00:56]
-No way! -All right!

[00:57]
-Your Squirt, sir. -Thank you.

[00:58]
And if that happens, take care of each other.

[01:01]
No matter what, we're going to stick together.

[01:07]
[unintelligible groans]

[01:18]
[♪♪]

[02:12]
[unintelligible groans continue]

[02:16]
Thank you, Tina, for those touching grunts and growls.

[02:19]
I'm Henry Winkler.

[02:20]
You probably remember me from my 2002 guest role

[02:24]
on Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit.

[02:26]
-Whoo! -Thank you.

[02:27]
But perhaps the greatest role I've ever played is friend.

[02:31]
Herb was a dear friend

[02:33]
and I am honored to be dedicating this bench in his memory.

[02:39]
In his last days, Herb's cancer had gone into remission.

[02:42]
He was full of hope.

[02:44]
But on the drive home from the hospital, his brakes gave out,

[02:47]
he crashed into a truck full of peanuts.

[02:49]
He survived the crash, but he was allergic to peanuts.

[02:53]
He died instantly.

[02:54]
Let us now read his final tweets.

[02:57]
"I'm gonna live forever!

[02:59]
Hashtag 'cancer free.'

[03:01]
Hashtag 'invincible.'

[03:02]
Hashtag 'tweeting while driving.'

[03:05]
Oh, no, I think I'm gonna hit that truck.

[03:08]
Hashtag 'hopefully it isn't full of peanuts.'

[03:11]
Hashtag 'Oh, no. It was full of peanuts.'"

[03:15]
I was wondering where you wandered off to.

[03:17]
-Oh, shit. Hey. -Hey.

[03:19]
I'm no good with funerals.

[03:21]
When I cry, it messes up my makeup and then I get really bummed out.

[03:25]
Yeah, same for me.

[03:26]
Herb told me you came by the house last summer.

[03:28]
Yeah?

[03:30]
Did he tell you anything else?

[03:32]
No, we talked about cancer, how hard it is living with cancer,

[03:35]
about the L.A. Kings, and then back to cancer.

[03:37]
-Probably-- -Then I read that chapter in your book

[03:40]
about how he never forgave you and he tried to kick you out of the house

[03:43]
and you ended up wrestling on the floor over a telescope.

[03:45]
-Oh, you did read that part? -Yeah.

[03:48]
I just wish there was something I could do.

[03:52]
Okay, I gotta go.

[03:53]
Wait, I haven't seen you in 30 years.

[03:55]
You wanna go grab a cup of vodka? I-- I'm sorry, the funeral.

[03:58]
I mean, a bottle of vodka?

[04:00]
No. You should stick around.

[04:02]
Hey, maybe you'll find that something you're looking for.

[04:05]
But if you're ever in New Mexico, drop me a line.

[04:07]
New Mexico?

[04:08]
I thought you lived in Maine.

[04:10]
I always pictured you there.

[04:11]
A little house by a lake?

[04:13]
I was just there for, like, a month, 30 years ago.

[04:15]
-I live outside Santa Fe now. -Oh.

[04:26]
-[sighs] Think everyone here read my book? -I didn't.

[04:29]
Of course you didn't.

[04:31]
Here's the CliffsNotes version: Shut up, Todd!

[04:33]
Okay, you're clearly in one of your moods.

[04:35]
I'm gonna go play astronaut in the trunk of your car for the next few hours.

[04:39]
Have fun being sad.

[04:41]
Do you know what you're supposed to do with our date pits?

[04:44]
Why serve dates and not have a place to put the pits?

[04:46]
You know, some people just have no class.

[04:48]
What are you doing here? You didn't know Herb.

[04:50]
No, but I do know a hot ticket, and this funeral's a real whom's-whom.

[04:54]
Henry Winkler, Jake and Maggot Gyllenhaal,

[04:56]
that Pakistani girl who keeps winning Nobel Prizes.

[04:59]
I'm gonna go rub me some elbows.

[05:01]
There's so much to hate about what you just said.

[05:03]
Good news. You know when someone dies, everyone wants to buy their shit?

[05:07]
You're lucky you have a piece of Horsin' Around,

[05:09]
because this is where money starts rolling in.

[05:11]
I don't want that. That's blood money.

[05:13]
Well, what do you want me to do with it? It's coming.

[05:15]
I don't know. Give it to some orphans.

[05:17]
-I can't deal with this. -Oh, come on!

[05:19]
You don't think Elton John was raking it in when Diana died?

[05:22]
More like "Candle in the Windfall." Cha-ching! Hmm...

[05:28]
[Herb] You have to live with the shitty thing you did for the rest of your life.

[05:33]
Huh.

[05:35]
[British accent] Hello, love.

[05:37]
Hey, Joelle, I actually came here to be alone.

[05:39]
I'm at my wit's end, I truly am.

[05:41]
I just flew in across the pond and I don't know which end is up.

[05:44]
This might be a stupid question, but were you always so... British?

[05:49]
Oh, let's get some light in here, it's so dreadfully dreary.

[05:52]
Because I'm, like, 70 percent sure you used to be American.

[05:55]
That's better.

[05:56]
Hey, this one's having a freak-out. She needs to lie down.

[05:58]
I'm not freaking out.

[06:00]
I just don't understand why that lady was being all judgy.

[06:03]
You were touching her face and telling her she was gonna die next.

[06:06]
I'm eccentric. I do weird shit.

[06:09]
How is that my problem?

[06:11]
Hey, when was the last time all four of us were in the same room?

[06:14]
Probably not since the show ended.

[06:17]
Yeah, I left California pretty much right after.

[06:19]
Now I got the biggest hardware store in Seattle.

[06:22]
That's a lie. We're actually in Olympia.

[06:24]
And I'm on the West End playing Juliet's... nurse.

[06:28]
-And how are your kids? -I don't have any kids.

[06:30]
Oh, I just assumed you had a bunch of kids,

[06:32]
'cause, you know, your body.

[06:35]
Come on, Sarah Lynn.

[06:35]
I assumed you weren't still a massive cunt.

[06:38]
-Jesus Christ, Joelle. -That's an okay thing to say in England.

[06:41]
Shove it up your ass with a spoonful of sugar,

[06:43]
you supercalifragilisticexpiali-bitch!

[06:46]
-Guys, hey, hey, come on. -Let go of me!

[06:48]
-I'm gonna hulk out! -Guys, can we just be civil for one day?

[06:51]
-Oh, you're one to talk. -What's that mean?

[06:53]
Were you being civil when you had sex with my mom?

[06:56]
What? I never-- Why would--? Wait, which one was your mom? Blond hair? Glasses?

[06:59]
-No. -This sucks. You guys suck.

[07:02]
I don't even know why I came to this party.

[07:04]
It's not a party, it's Herb's funeral.

[07:07]
Herb died?

[07:08]
You know, maybe it's for the best we don't get together that often.

[07:11]
We'd most likely drive each other mad.

[07:13]
Well, no one knows how to get under your skin like family.

[07:16]
We're not a family, BoJack.

[07:17]
We probably won't even see each other again, until the next funeral.

[07:22]
-Why are you all looking at me? -You are the oldest.

[07:25]
You are a severe alcoholic.

[07:27]
I'm honestly so high right now, I don't even know where I'm looking.

[07:30]
Anyway, so long, thanks for the memories,

[07:33]
and don't forget to suck a dick, dumbshi--

[07:36]
Pardon me. Is one of you Sarah Lynn?

[07:39]
I am. Of course. God, are you blind?

[07:42]
Yes.

[07:43]
Well, forgive me.

[07:44]
I'm Herb Kazzaz's blind executor.

[07:47]
Per the instructions of his last will and testament, I am to give you this disk.

[07:54]
Am I close?

[07:55]
Just take the disk from the guy.

[07:57]
It contains directions to Herb's gold.

[08:00]
Herb's gold?

[08:01]
There were no further details.

[08:03]
He was a peculiar client.

[08:05]
I told him, I'm not actually an attorney,

[08:08]
I'm just a blind man.

[08:09]
Still, Herb thought me wise for some reason.

[08:12]
Perhaps it is my overly formal manner of speech.

[08:16]
I bid you good day.

[08:19]
Oh, pardon me. Ow!

[08:21]
Right at shin level.

[08:22]
What are we supposed to do with a floppy disk?

[08:25]
Hmm...

[08:26]
So, what's up, kiddo?

[08:27]
BoJack and my mom are becoming, like, friends

[08:30]
and they're acting real weird.

[08:31]
Oof! Uh...

[08:33]
[rattling overhead]

[08:34]
Hey, guys, guys, come on!

[08:36]
There's somebody beneath you!

[08:38]
Jeez, all day with the...

[08:39]
Listen, kiddo, forget about them.

[08:41]
You wanna check out this cool new game I got?

[08:44]
You have solitaire? On your computer?

[08:47]
Yep. It only took 12 disks to install it.

[08:49]
Wow!

[08:51]
Herb's computer had a floppy disk drive.

[08:53]
I bet it's still in his old office. Unless somebody else moved in.

[08:56]
Nobody wanted Herb's office, remember?

[08:58]
Because it was under tap dancing star Savion Glover's office. Let's go.

[09:02]
-What? Right now? -Yeah. Don't you get it?

[09:05]
Herb's giving us a reunion special.

[09:06]
Remember how he always wanted to do a treasure hunt episode of Horsin' Around

[09:10]
but the network said it was too edgy? This is that episode.

[09:13]
-I just don't know. -Yeah, I don't want to do that.

[09:16]
Wait, so you'd rather just stay at this funeral and be sad,

[09:19]
instead of going on a crazy adventure to find our dead friend's secret treasure?

[09:23]
Do you have any idea how insane you sound?

[09:25]
Oh, I get it. You just don't wanna be here.

[09:28]
No, that's not it.

[09:29]
Herb clearly wanted us to do this, as a family.

[09:32]
Who cares what he wanted?

[09:33]
He doesn't, because he's dead.

[09:35]
And we all know he hated your guts.

[09:37]
Yeah. He was my best friend and he died hating me

[09:39]
and nothing I do is gonna change that,

[09:41]
but Herb left you that disk because he wanted us to find his gold.

[09:44]
If we can honor Herb's last wish, then that's something.

[09:49]
I don't know what, but it's something.

[09:53]
-Okay. For Herb. -Fine.

[09:55]
-Shotgun! -Everyone knows you can't call shotgun

[09:58]
-before you see the car! -My turn! Get out of my way!

[10:00]
Brad, hang on one second.

[10:02]
Your mom wasn't redheaded twins, right?

[10:05]
-No. -Okay.

[10:07]
Hi, Henry Winkler.

[10:09]
I loved you in that one episode of Law &amp; Order: SVU.

[10:12]
Oh, thank you.

[10:14]
How would you like to narrate a documentary for--

[10:16]
Hey, listen, I am so flattered,

[10:18]
but today is about Herb, so let's respect that.

[10:22]
Oh, God, I-- I'm so sorry.

[10:24]
I'll let you get back to your business.

[10:27]
Hey, Winkly, such a shame, isn't it? About our friend Herb?

[10:32]
It really burns my brisket

[10:34]
that some people would turn a funeral into some kind of schmoozefest.

[10:37]
Yeah. I know.

[10:39]
Those other people are the worst.

[10:41]
I bet that woman barely knew Herb.

[10:44]
Anyway, hi, I'm Henry.

[10:45]
I used to volunteer with Herb at Habitat For Humanity.

[10:48]
Or as we like to call it, Herbitat For Henranity. [laughs]

[10:52]
We spent most of the day working on that name,

[10:55]
and only part of the day building, but still, we helped some people.

[10:59]
-How did you know Herb? -We also volunteered at a, um...

[11:03]
soup plantation-- Kitchen! Soup kitchen! Whichever one is the good one.

[11:08]
What? I never knew you did that.

[11:11]
Princess Carolyn, please elaborate.

[11:13]
Oh, hey, Mr. Peanutbutter, why don't you talk about how you knew Herb?

[11:16]
Oh, I never met the guy. I'm just here to schmooze.

[11:19]
Tell us about your thing, though, it sounds fascinating.

[11:23]
Everyone, gather round and listen to Princess Carolyn's story.

[11:26]
Okay.

[11:31]
Wow, Herb kept all this old stuff.

[11:34]
He sure did.

[11:35]
Look, one of those answering machines with tapes.

[11:40]
Mr. Kazzaz, this is Manny from Pep Boys.

[11:42]
We fixed the brakes on your car, pick it up tomorrow.

[11:45]
Just to reiterate, your brakes are in great shape

[11:48]
and shouldn't give you any more trouble.

[11:50]
Unless, of course, someone intentionally cut them,

[11:53]
but why would anyone do that? I'm sorry, I'm rambling.

[11:56]
Probably because I'm such a big fan.

[11:59]
Horsin' Around was a goddamn riot!

[12:02]
I especially loved those kids.

[12:04]
You know, wasn't so crazy about the horse, though--

[12:06]
Message deleted.

[12:09]
Mm... How curious.

[12:10]
How could you like Horsin' Around but not the horse?

[12:13]
That's like watching Castle but hating castles.

[12:15]
I mean, I've never seen it. I assume it's about castles.

[12:18]
-Wow! -[all yell]

[12:19]
Look at all these old [00:00]h century relics.

[12:24]
-How did you get here? -I was in your trunk.

[12:26]
Now I'm in outer space.

[12:30]
Cut it out with your childish high jinks.

[12:32]
Yeah, get out of here, dweeb.

[12:33]
Whoa, can't I help?

[12:35]
Here's 10 bucks. There's a Squirt machine by the garage. Get five cans.

[12:38]
You got it. I won't let you down.

[12:41]
-[clattering, thumping] -Oh, no!

[12:43]
Your mom, was her name Karen?

[12:44]
-Can we drop it? -Something with a "K"?

[12:46]
Her name is Nora. You know, my parents got a divorce because of you.

[12:49]
Nora? I don't know. I banged so many chicks in the '80s.

[12:55]
Okay, Todd, you can do this.

[12:58]
Five Squirts.

[12:59]
You just need to take this money and put it in that machine.

[13:03]
This-- Wait, what? What happened to the $10?

[13:06]
[grunting]

[13:08]
No! Wind! Be cool!

[13:11]
-Hey! That's mine! -[screeching]

[13:13]
-[screams] -Oh...

[13:15]
[screeches] [thud]

[13:17]
Why does this always happen to me?

[13:23]
Looks like Herb set up a password.

[13:25]
Oh, this is easy. Try "BoJack."

[13:28]
-No. Didn't work. -"BoJack-BFF"?

[13:30]
"BoJack-I-Forgive-You"?

[13:33]
Well, I'm out of ideas.

[13:34]
Hmm...

[13:37]
I'm just, like, so mad.

[13:39]
Well, you should be.

[13:40]
You're on the show that fired Herb Kazzaz.

[13:43]
What are the writers doing to my baby? Are they killing it?

[13:45]
Are they putting my baby into a car, then driving the car into a lake?

[13:49]
Topical! I still got it!

[13:51]
They keep giving the best story lines to Sarah Lynn.

[13:54]
I haven't gotten a single very special episode.

[13:56]
When am I gonna learn about drunk driving?

[13:59]
Don't worry so much. It's my legacy they're crapping all over.

[14:02]
You're gonna come out smelling like a daisy.

[14:04]
You're too good for this TV stuff, anyway.

[14:06]
You're a real actress, you should be doing theater.

[14:08]
Hold on.

[14:09]
Hey, Joelle. Wanna go to the mall this weekend?

[14:12]
Don't you have any friends your own age from school?

[14:14]
No. My mom's boyfriend home-schools me. He's a photographer.

[14:18]
I'm going to the Lilith Fair this weekend to support female solidarity.

[14:21]
-So scram! -Oh...

[14:24]
Hey, be nicer to Sarah Lynn, will you? She didn't choose this life.

[14:27]
Remember this word: family.

[14:29]
Okay? You two are family, whether you like it or not,

[14:32]
and that's the most important thing. You listening? What's the most important?

[14:36]
Family. It's family. I get it.

[14:39]
I've got it! The password is...

[14:42]
"password."

[14:45]
It worked!

[14:46]
Good thinking, Joelle.

[14:47]
So in that memory, were you British or American?

[14:49]
The disk just has just one file on it, it's--

[14:52]
It's the address of a storage locker in Van Nuys.

[14:54]
A storage locker? Ugh!

[14:57]
This treasure hunt sucks.

[14:58]
[rattling overhead]

[15:00]
At long last, can you keep down the noise, keep down the funk?

[15:04]
If tap dancing was gonna be a cool thing, it would have caught on by now!

[15:12]
And when the mayor gave us the key to the city,

[15:16]
Herb said, "Volunteering isn't about keys. It's about people."

[15:22]
-How touching. -Good story.

[15:23]
-Who are you again? -Wow, that was touching.

[15:26]
A story that could never be topped.

[15:28]
Or could it?

[15:29]
Princess Carolyn, sing us another song in the key of Kazzaz.

[15:33]
You clearly knew the man so well.

[15:35]
Please tell us another story but with even more details.

[15:39]
Yes. That's a great idea, Mr. Dog-Man.

[15:42]
Tell us another story, Pink Cat Lady.

[15:45]
Story, story!

[15:46]
Come on, everybody. What is this, a funeral?

[15:48]
[all] Story, story, story!

[15:52]
Well, you blew it again.

[15:54]
You really are a dweeb.

[15:56]
Don't say that.

[15:57]
Whoa, who are you?

[16:00]
Some kind of magical trash troll?

[16:02]
No. I'm a janitor.

[16:03]
But I was clearing out some of the old stages,

[16:06]
and I found this transformation chamber.

[16:09]
Looks like a bunch of old junk.

[16:11]
Let me tell you a story.

[16:13]
Back in the '90s, the biggest dweeb of them all was Steve Urkel.

[16:18]
Oh, yeah.

[16:19]
It was so funny how he never knew whether or not he did that.

[16:22]
Right. Well, nerdy Steve Urkel invented a machine

[16:26]
that transformed him into the debonair Stefan Urquelle.

[16:30]
Mr. Janitor, you're standing next to a machine right now.

[16:35]
Yes. That's why I brought it up.

[16:37]
Now, this is just a prop.

[16:39]
But it represents a very powerful idea.

[16:42]
So if I go through that magic machine, I'll become cool and confident?

[16:47]
No, it's a-- It's a prop. I just said--

[16:50]
[inhales, exhales deeply]

[16:55]
-I feel different. -Now, son--

[16:58]
Todd? Who's Todd?

[17:00]
My name's Toad. Toad Chavay.

[17:03]
And I gotta get my bubble on.

[17:05]
Machine? Squirt me. Hi-yah!

[17:11]
That'll do, machine.

[17:18]
Hmm...

[17:20]
Look at all this Horsin' Around fan correspondence

[17:23]
Herb received in the post. Capital!

[17:25]
Guys.

[17:29]
[all gasp]

[17:29]
Someone already got to Herb's gold.

[17:32]
Oh, shit.

[17:33]
There's a bunch of fur in here.

[17:36]
It's bear fur.

[17:38]
I can tell. My stepdad was a bear.

[17:40]
Herb's nurse is a bear. You think she knew about this gold?

[17:44]
Hey, listen to this letter. I think it might be a clue.

[17:47]
Ahem. "Dear Herb, just finished reading your novel.

[17:50]
It's phenomenal.

[17:51]
I'm jealous. I wish I wrote it.

[17:54]
Sincerely, Henry Winkler,

[17:57]
the guy from that one episode of Law &amp; Order: SVU."

[18:00]
Herb wrote a novel?

[18:01]
Oh...

[18:04]
You look thin. Did you get into CrossFit?

[18:06]
No, Sarah Lynn, I'm dying.

[18:08]
Whatever it is, it is super slimming. I am for totes jel over here.

[18:11]
It's rectal cancer.

[18:12]
Ew! Some of us are eating.

[18:15]
Look, the reason I called you is because I need a favor.

[18:18]
Want me to leak a nude pic for charity?

[18:19]
I want you to sober up.

[18:22]
First of all, rude. Second, gross. And third, why?

[18:25]
I have a very important job for you, but if you're zonked out all the time,

[18:29]
I'm not sure I can trust you with the responsibility.

[18:32]
No! I can do it! I'll get clean tomorrow.

[18:35]
[sniffing]

[18:36]
I said tomorrow, right?

[18:38]
I've been working on this novel. I wanna be remembered for something.

[18:42]
All I ever did was that stupid sitcom that got ripped away from me.

[18:45]
But now, with this book, I have something good.

[18:48]
I'm telling you, this book is gold.

[18:51]
-It's my Kazzaz-terpiece. -Whoa.

[18:54]
I want you to make sure it gets published after I die.

[18:58]
You can count on me.

[18:59]
To life, huh? It'll kill you.

[19:02]
Oh, my God, the gold is his manuscript.

[19:05]
Herb made me promise to get it published after he died.

[19:08]
And you're just remembering this now?

[19:10]
Yeah, I'm remembering a lot of stuff. The ketamine's wearing off.

[19:14]
Oh, my God, you were the other kid on Horsin' Around.

[19:17]
That's why you've been following us around all day.

[19:20]
So no one's read this book except for Henry Winkler

[19:24]
-and now the book is missing? -He must have been waiting for Herb to die

[19:28]
so he could steal the book and publish it himself.

[19:30]
But then when the cancer went into remission--

[19:33]
Oh, my God.

[19:34]
Guys, I don't think that car crash was an accident.

[19:36]
I think Herb might have been murdered!

[19:39]
[gasping]

[19:40]
[huffing]

[19:41]
What's going on?

[19:42]
Something about a merger?

[19:48]
My name's Toad, baby.

[19:58]
Yeah.

[20:00]
Coolsville, daddy-o.

[20:03]
Oh, lookie here.

[20:06]
Yeah.

[20:08]
Yo! That's my bike!

[20:11]
Oops. Did I do that?

[20:16]
Damn. I know I should be mad, but that guy's just so cool.

[20:22]
And when the river finally stopped,

[20:24]
Herb went over to a poor little Ottawan boy

[20:27]
and he said, "Son, you have water now."

[20:29]
You know, a lot of people go their whole lives and they never give a damn.

[20:32]
But Herb? He gave those beavers a dam.

[20:36]
That was beautiful.

[20:38]
You clearly had a special relationship.

[20:41]
We were gonna sprinkle Herb over the ocean,

[20:43]
but his resting place should be someplace meaningful, don't you think?

[20:46]
Why don't you take this up to Ottawa and spread his ashes there.

[20:50]
And make sure you take a video, and I'll e-mail blast it to everyone here.

[20:53]
So we can always remember your great friendship.

[20:56]
Everybody, stop!

[20:57]
Henry Winkler is a stone-cold killer!

[21:00]
[all gasp]

[21:01]
What? I'm not a killer.

[21:02]
Unless you mean killer of gloom, because I bring joy everywhere I go.

[21:06]
Did you mean "killer of gloom because I bring joy everywhere I go"?

[21:09]
You know that's not what I meant.

[21:11]
You murdered Herb so you could publish his book.

[21:14]
But we're not gonna let you steal his legacy, Henry Winkler.

[21:17]
I was afraid this would happen.

[21:21]
-Oh, no, he's got a gun! -Oh, no!

[21:22]
What?

[21:26]
No, I have Herb's book.

[21:30]
I didn't kill Herb, but I did steal his manuscript.

[21:34]
-So that I could burn it. -What?

[21:36]
Because it's terrible.

[21:38]
Well, I'll see for myself.

[21:40]
"The air in 1830s California was fragrant with the flowers of laughter

[21:44]
and the smoke of adventure."

[21:46]
-What? -Uh.

[21:47]
After he died, Tina and I agreed we couldn't let the book get published.

[21:52]
It would have turned Herb into a laughingstock.

[21:55]
"The carpenter's boy was a hungry boy.

[21:57]
Hungry for crumpets. But also hungry, dot, dot, dot, for life."

[22:01]
He literally wrote out "dot, dot, dot."

[22:03]
I know there's no accounting for taste, but come on.

[22:06]
[BoJack sighs]

[22:08]
He's right. Herb wanted a legacy, but he already has one.

[22:12]
People loved Horsin' Around. This would only ruin that.

[22:15]
I'm sorry I accused you of murder, American TV legend Henry Winkler.

[22:19]
No need to apologize.

[22:21]
You ascribed a mystery to Herb's death to give it meaning.

[22:24]
But there is no meaning in death.

[22:26]
That's why it's so terrifying.

[22:28]
It was just easier to believe that you killed him for his book

[22:31]
than believe that he just died for nothing.

[22:34]
There is no shame in dying for nothing.

[22:37]
That's why most people die.

[22:38]
I just wanted to fix things somehow.

[22:42]
I'm sorry, Horse Guy, but you can't.

[22:50]
Wow, heady stuff.

[22:52]
But let's not get distracted

[22:54]
from what a true friend Princess Carolyn is.

[22:57]
Don't forget the ashes, Princess Carolyn.

[22:59]
Fantastic.

[23:08]
Hey. Special delivery.

[23:10]
Courtesy of the Toad-man.

[23:12]
Thanks. Hey, why'd you roll up your sleeves like that? You look weird.

[23:15]
Oh, I-- [coughs]

[23:18]
Well, you know, I was-- I was trying out a new look.

[23:20]
It was-- It was a dumb idea.

[23:23]
Yup. Whoa! Oh, no! Ow... Ow!

[23:29]
-Here's your Squirt, sir. -Thank you.

[23:32]
And if that happens, I want you to take care of each other.

[23:34]
No matter what, we're going to stick together.

[23:37]
-Congratulations! -Hey, good job.

[23:39]
-You've got a goddamn hit on your hands. -Anyone got coke?

[23:42]
ABC sent us limousines to take us to the wrap party.

[23:46]
I'm scared. I've never been in a limo.

[23:49]
Don't worry. We'll take care of you.

[23:51]
-Seriously, no one has coke? -Let's go.

[23:54]
You don't wanna go to the party?

[23:56]
Nah.

[23:57]
Hey, we never got a chance to walk around the lot.

[24:00]
Wanna check out that water tank where they filmed The Love Boat?

[24:02]
Are you kidding? I've always wanted to get tanked in a tank.

[24:08]
-[laughing] -Shh.

[24:09]
-Quiet. Be careful. -Oh, okay, okay.

[24:13]
You ready?

[24:15]
-What? -What--? The water's only two inches deep.

[24:18]
Well, that's Hollywood for you.

[24:23]
Hey.

[24:24]
Are you scared at all?

[24:27]
That if the show takes off, everything's going to change?

[24:31]
[laughs] No, I'm not scared, BJ. The future is bright.

[24:35]
Just look at it.
