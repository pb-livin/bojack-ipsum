[00:05]
[polite applause]

[00:06]
[male TV host] When we booked you for this show,

[00:08]
you'd just won the Triple Crown, but then just this week,

[00:12]
I open up the newspaper, and look at this...

[00:15]
"Secretariat Under Investigation."

[00:17]
What am I supposed to do with that?

[00:19]
Maybe it's a different Secretariat.

[00:21]
Ha ha ha ha. No, but seriously, folks,

[00:23]
there is no truth to these allegations.

[00:26]
I have never bet on horse racing,

[00:28]
and I certainly did not bet on my own races.

[00:31]
Although I did bet the network's gonna give your show

[00:33]
back to Joey Bishop.

[00:34]
O-- ho ho-- kay.

[00:36]
We get letters here on the show, and one particular letter,

[00:39]
for you, actually, struck a chord with our producers.

[00:42]
This is from BoJack H. BoJack is nine years old.

[00:45]
BoJack writes, "Dear Secretariat,

[00:48]
I am a horse just like you.

[00:50]
I like to watch racing, and you are my favorite racer."

[00:52]
Smart kid.

[00:54]
"When I grow up, I want to be just like you,

[00:55]
and I think I'm on the right track.

[00:57]
Get it? Track, because horses run on tracks,

[01:00]
and you are a horse, and I am a horse.

[01:02]
Do you get it? Do you get my joke about the track?"

[01:04]
Okay, there's a whole page of this.

[01:06]
Should I write him back and tell him I get it?

[01:08]
He goes on, "My question for you is,

[01:10]
I am a good kid, and I like to play,

[01:12]
and I like to go to school, but sometimes I get sad.

[01:16]
What do you do when you get sad?

[01:18]
How do you not be sad? Sincerely, BoJack."

[01:20]
That's a great letter.

[01:22]
BoJack, when I was your age, I got sad.

[01:25]
A lot.

[01:27]
I didn't come from such a great home,

[01:30]
but one day, I started running, and that seemed to make sense,

[01:33]
so then I just kept running.

[01:35]
BoJack, when you get sad, you run straight ahead

[01:39]
and you keep running forward, no matter what.

[01:42]
There are people in your life

[01:43]
who are gonna try to hold you back, slow you down,

[01:45]
but you don't let them.

[01:47]
Don't you stop running and don't you ever look behind you.

[01:49]
There's nothing for you behind you.

[01:51]
All that exists is what's ahead.

[01:54]
[man 1] Good morning, Louisville. It's August 22nd, 1973.

[01:59]
[man 2] A sad day for the sport of horse racing.

[02:01]
Secretariat banned for life from competition.

[02:04]
[man 1] It's a disgrace is what it is. This is the '70s.

[02:07]
You can't cheat in sports and get away with it.

[02:09]
[man 2] You know, I think it just goes to show you,

[02:11]
you can be the fastest runner in the world,

[02:14]
but you can't outrun the truth.

[02:18]
[wind whooshes]

[02:19]
[man 3] And traffic is jammed today coming into Louisville.

[02:22]
Looks like some idiot parked his car on the bridge.

[02:24]
[funky electronic music]

[02:27]
♪ ♪

[03:21]
And the Golden Globe for Best Comedy or Musical

[03:24]
goes to BoJack Horseman, my friend,

[03:28]
for his book One Trick Pony.

[03:30]
[woman] This is a first win for BoJack Horseman

[03:33]
and his first appearance at the Globe ceremony

[03:35]
since his forced removal in 1992

[03:37]
after he exchanged blows with Sir Paul McCartney.

[03:41]
Wow, what an honor.

[03:42]
I have to thank the Hollywoo Foreign Press.

[03:44]
I feel like I should mention

[03:46]
that my book was not a comedy or a musical.

[03:48]
Do you guys actually watch the movies you give awards to?

[03:50]
'Cause I kind of get the sense that--

[03:51]
Also, my book was not a movie. You do know that, right?

[03:53]
We're friends.

[03:55]
Anyway, the response to this book has been incredible.

[03:57]
These last three months have been really amazing.

[04:00]
You know, a lot of people said to me,

[04:02]
"You sure you want to publish this book?

[04:03]
It's pretty personal."

[04:05]
And I said, "If I can make just one person out there

[04:07]
feel a little less alone, then it's all worth it."

[04:10]
And they said, "That's really brave."

[04:12]
And I said, "Well, I'm not one to call myself brave,

[04:15]
but since you said it, yeah, I am."

[04:17]
- After-party at my restaurant! - [cheering, applause]

[04:20]
Why did I say after-party at my restaurant?

[04:22]
I do not want to throw a party.

[04:24]
It did seem unlike you. I'm gonna go get some cotton candy.

[04:26]
- You want some? - No.

[04:28]
- Yes. - There he is, man of the hour.

[04:32]
- Hello, other grown up. - Ugh.

[04:34]
Oh, cheer up, dummy. Your book is a huge success.

[04:37]
Everybody loves you. You just won a Golden Globe.

[04:40]
If you can't be happy tonight,

[04:41]
maybe you'll never be happy again.

[04:43]
I'm sorry, is that supposed to be encouraging?

[04:45]
- Because it's super-bleak. - Vincent Adultman...

[04:47]
how are things at the old nine to five?

[04:50]
Good. I went to the stock market today.

[04:52]
I did a business.

[04:54]
I keep telling him he works too hard.

[04:56]
Come on, Vincent, let's get away from the rat race.

[04:58]
Take a cruise someplace wet and Latin.

[05:01]
I mean, can you imagine this body in a swimsuit?

[05:04]
- I literally cannot. - Vincent, let's do a lap.

[05:06]
Have you met Brendan Fraser?

[05:08]
I feel like you two would love each other.

[05:10]
Whoa. Easy, easy.

[05:11]
I got to hand it to Diane.

[05:13]
This book has been everything she said it would be.

[05:15]
Yeah, she knows what she's doing.

[05:17]
How is Diane? I haven't seen her since...

[05:19]
Well, I haven't seen her in a while.

[05:21]
Oh, well, the book's been huge for her, too.

[05:23]
She's practically as famous as I am now.

[05:25]
- We're like the Brangelinas. - Well, I'm happy she's happy.

[05:28]
- And how are you? - Well, it's been really hard--

[05:30]
Erica, is that you? Who let you out of the burn ward?

[05:34]
- Get over here, you. - Uhh.

[05:36]
Excuse me. I just have to tell you how much I love your book.

[05:40]
It's so naked and honest and revealing.

[05:43]
It is? Uh-oh.

[05:45]
I love the part about how you became famous

[05:46]
so you could be constantly surrounded by distraction

[05:49]
and wouldn't have to be alone with yourself.

[05:51]
I thought that was a really profound observation.

[05:53]
Oh, yeah, definitely. So profound.

[05:54]
- Do you want to get out of here? - What?

[05:56]
Come back to my place, maybe get a little more naked,

[05:58]
- honest and revealing? - Oh, no. No, thanks.

[06:01]
- What about you? - Yeah, okay.

[06:03]
[woman moaning and panting]

[06:05]
[BoJack groans]

[06:07]
- Oh-- Whoa. - [screams]

[06:10]
Huh.

[06:14]
- Hey, Diane. - You still friends with BoJack?

[06:16]
Heard you two were on the outs.

[06:18]
You gonna write another book about it?

[06:19]
Oh, you looking at some oranges?

[06:21]
You gonna write a book about those oranges, huh?

[06:23]
[cell phone vibrates]

[06:24]
- Hello. - Diane.

[06:26]
Sebastian St. Claire here,

[06:28]
famed billionaire philanthropist/adventurer.

[06:30]
Please, hold your applause.

[06:33]
- Okay. - You can applaud a little.

[06:35]
Okay.

[06:37]
I got your number from Pinky Penguin.

[06:39]
I'm looking for a journalist to follow me around

[06:41]
for a few months and document my daring exploits

[06:44]
aiding ravaged communities and displaced people.

[06:47]
- Ssss. - Wow, that sounds amazing.

[06:50]
But that's not usually the kind of thing I write about.

[06:53]
Diane, if you can make people care about BoJack Horseman,

[06:58]
surely you can make them care about emaciated orphans

[07:01]
with missing limbs.

[07:03]
We need to wake people up.

[07:05]
Well, I am a morning person.

[07:07]
I hope you mean mourning with a "u,"

[07:09]
because, Diane, this is deadly serious.

[07:12]
Oh, yes, of course.

[07:16]
You want to spend three months in Sudan?

[07:19]
Not just there. We're also going to Haiti and Thailand

[07:21]
and Uganda and Chechnya.

[07:23]
Can't you do all that in L.A.?

[07:25]
I want to do something important.

[07:27]
I want to help people and do good work

[07:30]
and sleep on the ground and poop in a bucket.

[07:33]
Honey, nobody wants to poop in a bucket.

[07:36]
Maybe I do. Maybe I want to poop in a bucket.

[07:39]
If you want to poop in a bucket, we can get you a bucket.

[07:41]
You don't have to go all the way the Chechnylavakia.

[07:43]
Am I saying that right?

[07:45]
It's not just the pooping in a bucket.

[07:47]
I think it might be good for me to get out of L.A.

[07:49]
for a little bit.

[07:50]
Sweetie, you know I support you, whatever you want to do,

[07:53]
but you're not gonna find what you're looking for

[07:55]
in these awful made-up places.

[07:57]
The universe is a cruel, uncaring void.

[08:00]
The key to being happy isn't a search for meaning.

[08:02]
It's to just keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense,

[08:05]
and eventually, you'll be dead.

[08:07]
Well, I guess I can keep my options open.

[08:11]
Great.

[08:12]
[whistles gleefully]

[08:14]
Hey, can I ask you something?

[08:17]
Did Vincent seem extra weird to you last night?

[08:21]
Well, he's still three kids in a trench coat, so, no.

[08:24]
We're going through a rough patch. It's hard, you know.

[08:26]
He's works a full time job at the business factory,

[08:28]
so when he gets home,

[08:30]
he just wants to unwind by watching R-rated movies.

[08:32]
Ahh, I thought I was ready for a real adult relationship,

[08:34]
- but-- - [snores]

[08:36]
Enough about me. BoJack, you are on fire.

[08:38]
Oh, are we talking about me again?

[08:40]
We have an offer on the table for you to play the bad guy

[08:43]
in the new James Bond.

[08:44]
- Ehh. - I agree. Total garbage.

[08:47]
But this, it's a new drama from the Coen Brothers.

[08:49]
A western about a one-horse town and you're the horse.

[08:52]
Hello, Oscar. What do you think?

[08:54]
I think now's the time to finally make "Secretariat."

[08:57]
Really? Now? Aren't you a little, um, very too old?

[09:00]
You asked me what I wanted to do. That's what I want.

[09:02]
That's all I've ever wanted, and if I can't get it now,

[09:05]
then all of this has been for nothing.

[09:07]
Oh, fish. Of course!

[09:09]
Why would you ever make things easy for me

[09:11]
when instead you could make things incredibly difficult?

[09:13]
Laura, clear out the rest of my day.

[09:15]
I have to push a boulder up a hill,

[09:17]
and then have it roll over me time and time again

[09:20]
with no regard for my well-being.

[09:22]
Attagirl.

[09:25]
All right, Todd. PB Livin' needs a new project.

[09:27]
Bi-Monthly Curated Box of Snacks has been an enormous success,

[09:30]
but I got into this game to make movies,

[09:33]
so let's make a movie.

[09:34]
Well, I got a stack of great scripts here.

[09:36]
Any one of them would make a wonderful movie.

[09:38]
Fantastic.

[09:39]
But I also have this other non-movie-related idea.

[09:44]
Ooh, let's hear the other idea.

[09:45]
Okay. I was heading down Wilshire,

[09:47]
and I saw this empty store front, and I thought,

[09:50]
"You know what this world needs?"

[09:52]
Edge of my seat over here.

[09:54]
A store where people can buy Halloween stuff.

[09:57]
Halloween store. Feel like that's been done.

[10:00]
Yeah, in October,

[10:02]
but how come your never see a Halloween store in January?

[10:06]
- It's an untapped market. - Yeah.

[10:08]
A Halloween store that's open year-round.

[10:10]
- No, no. Just January. - Brilliant.

[10:13]
That's the kind of idea that wins Golden Globes.

[10:19]
I actually think the time is right for "Secretariat,"

[10:21]
so what do you want to play, like, Secretariat's dad

[10:23]
or his grandfather, maybe like an elderly witch doctor

[10:26]
who puts a curse on him or something?

[10:28]
Lenny, look, I know I'm a little long in the tooth,

[10:30]
but I think that you more than anyone

[10:32]
would know not to count out an old pro.

[10:34]
Don't play the ageism card with me, kid.

[10:36]
I've laid farts that lasted longer than your entire career.

[10:39]
But Secretariat was dead at 27, so who we kidding here?

[10:42]
Just set the project up and give me an audition.

[10:44]
- That's all I ask. - All right.

[10:45]
You got yourself a "go" picture, kid.

[10:47]
And by you, I mean me. And by "go" picture,

[10:49]
I mean I'll make some phone calls, we'll see what I can do.

[10:51]
And by kid, I mean middle-aged adult.

[10:56]
[whispers] Shh. No, no, no. Put it here. Put it here.

[10:58]
- [whispers] Okay, I'll do it. - Ahem.

[11:01]
- Has this ever happened to you? - Has what ever happened to me?

[11:04]
- Todd? - Yes, Mr. Peanutbutter?

[11:07]
What's going on? Why are you talking like that?

[11:09]
Todd, I just got a phenomenal idea

[11:11]
for a Halloween costume.

[11:13]
Why don't you and I dash over to the store right quick

[11:15]
and spend some hard-earned American money?

[11:17]
Oh, but, Mr. Peanutbutter, didn't you hear?

[11:20]
It's January, and the Halloween store won't open

[11:23]
for another nine months.

[11:26]
But I want satisfaction now.

[11:28]
Has this ever happened to you?

[11:31]
Not to anyone ever at any time.

[11:33]
Ahem. We give you Halloween in January,

[11:37]
a truly immersive Halloween experience

[11:40]
for the rest of us.

[11:42]
Halloween in January? Please elaborate.

[11:45]
Okay, but before I do, tell the audience.

[11:47]
- Have we ever met before? - Never.

[11:49]
Well, according to facts, there's more suicides in January

[11:53]
- than any other month. - I'm getting pretty close over here.

[11:55]
Also, there's less Halloween stores. Coincidence?

[12:00]
Wow, I'm convinced. This store could save lives.

[12:03]
Unbelievable. When your powers combine...

[12:05]
you are somehow even more stupid than the sum of your stupids.

[12:09]
- Thank you. - Go on.

[12:10]
You stop encouraging him and you stop encouraging him.

[12:13]
The two of you are playing with fire.

[12:15]
A fire called Having a Good Idea.

[12:17]
Or maybe a fire called Friendship.

[12:20]
- Fires aren't called things. - What about the Chicago fire?

[12:23]
Or Fire Island.

[12:24]
- Or Gabe. - Who's Gabe?

[12:26]
Just a fire I met once. Named him Gabe.

[12:28]
- He sounds delightful. - He was. Good guy.

[12:30]
[groans]

[12:37]
Business, business, business. Is that all you ever think about?

[12:40]
I don't know.

[12:41]
What's under that coat, Vincent?

[12:43]
- You need to let me in. - Not right now.

[12:46]
I have to call the guy at the office

[12:47]
and take the car to the place.

[12:50]
It's always guys in places with you.

[12:51]
You know, I thought I wanted to date a real adult,

[12:54]
but I'm actually young at heart.

[12:56]
I need to feel the grass between my toes.

[12:58]
I want to wear jeans. I want to dance.

[13:01]
- That's baby stuff. - No, Vincent.

[13:03]
There's more to being an adult than just work and business

[13:05]
and the tall-person rides at Disneyland. I want to have fun.

[13:09]
There has to be a difference between monogamy and monotony.

[13:12]
What's mahumanunny?

[13:14]
Well, clearly we had a different understanding

[13:16]
of what this was.

[13:18]
I'd like to be an adult about this, but frankly, I'm hurt.

[13:21]
I think you should just go, just git. Get out of my life.

[13:25]
Okay.

[13:26]
Okay.

[13:28]
Could I have another soda?

[13:33]
BoJack, you know Kelsey Jannings, our director.

[13:37]
I really appreciate you giving me this opportunity.

[13:39]
Yeah.

[13:41]
Secretariat was kind of my hero as a kid.

[13:44]
Yeah, he was a lot of people's hero.

[13:46]
Well, you know, here was a guy who had everything--

[13:48]
Yeah, I know the story. I'm the director.

[13:51]
Kelsey, be nice.

[13:52]
She's just cranky because she's already seen 30 people

[13:55]
read for this today, and we are all so goddamn sick

[13:57]
of seeing auditions, so whenever you're ready.

[14:00]
Just jump right in.

[14:01]
Great. Let's get to it.

[14:03]
[stilted] Hey, ain't you that horse

[14:05]
- that won all them races? - Not today, ma'am.

[14:08]
Today I'm just a customer who wants a warm slice of pie.

[14:11]
Can I ask you a question?

[14:13]
When you're out there on that there racetrack,

[14:15]
- what are you running from? - You want to know the truth?

[14:18]
Nothing.

[14:19]
Everyone's running from something, sugar.

[14:21]
No, I'm running from nothing. I'm terrified of nothing.

[14:26]
People come up to me, they want my autograph,

[14:28]
they want my picture.

[14:29]
They think they recognize something in me,

[14:32]
and I want to be that person they think I am, but I'm not.

[14:35]
They see a greatness in me, and they mistake it for goodness,

[14:38]
but I... I know there's nothing there.

[14:41]
As fast as I run, I can't get way from that.

[14:46]
- Oh. - Wow.

[14:47]
BoJack, I think I speak for everyone when I say--

[14:51]
Oh, my God, Andrew Garfield said yes.

[14:55]
- We have our Secretariat. - We got Andrew Garfield?

[14:58]
Oh, my God, it's the best day of my life.

[14:59]
[Lenny] You don't say no to Spider-Man.

[15:01]
[Kelsey] This movie is gonna be amazing.

[15:02]
Andrew...

[15:03]
Garfield!

[15:06]
Now, the pills will give you nightmares--

[15:09]
I mean, just horrifying--

[15:10]
but the malaria will give you death,

[15:12]
so you're going to want to take the pills, Diane.

[15:15]
- Uh-huh. - Hold on.

[15:16]
A mosquito got into my tent. What do you want?

[15:21]
- [cell phone vibrates] - Hello?

[15:23]
Diane, it's Princess Carolyn, BoJack's agent.

[15:25]
Yeah, I know who you are.

[15:27]
I'm the pink cat, the one who used to date BoJack.

[15:29]
We've met a lot of times. You came to my wedding.

[15:32]
Listen, the Turteltaub Company

[15:33]
is making a movie about Secretariat.

[15:35]
And since you're such an expert,

[15:37]
they want to bring you on board as a character consultant.

[15:40]
What does that mean?

[15:42]
Oh, it's the cushiest job in the world.

[15:44]
You sit in a fancy chair and eat pastries all day.

[15:46]
And then once a week, you say, "Secretariat wouldn't do that."

[15:49]
I don't know. I've already been offered this other thing.

[15:51]
And did you know there are orphans in Sudan--

[15:53]
You take this job, you can buy all the orphans you want.

[15:55]
No, I don't want to buy them.

[15:57]
Look, if you really want to help people,

[15:59]
it doesn't hurt to have a little money in your pocket.

[16:01]
Take the job now, help the orphans later.

[16:03]
- There's always later. - Hmm.

[16:06]
Okay, talk it over with your husband.

[16:07]
I got to go get my whiskers trimmed.

[16:09]
I run into walls for days, but I look hot.

[16:14]
- How's the pie here? - Not good.

[16:16]
Well, I'll take all you got.

[16:18]
Screw it. Throw it in a bowl with some bourbon

[16:19]
- and bring me a ladle. - Mm-hmm.

[16:22]
BoJack, we notice you've been pretty down in the dumps lately,

[16:26]
but we have something that we think is going to cheer you up.

[16:29]
It's an exciting new business venture

[16:31]
that's equal parts new and exciting.

[16:34]
Another one? What happened to your Halloween store?

[16:37]
- What now? - Oh, right.

[16:38]
The Halloween store.

[16:40]
We took the floor out

[16:42]
because Mr. Peanutbutter kept scratching up the hardwood,

[16:45]
and then-- Did we ever get the new floor installed?

[16:47]
Uh...

[16:49]
Halloween? In January?

[16:51]
What a great ide-- Aah!

[16:53]
[thud]

[16:55]
Anyway, now we're all about smoodies.

[16:57]
- What? - Smoodies.

[16:59]
You're saying smoothies, right? Smoothies.

[17:01]
No. Smoodies.

[17:03]
It's a mood that you drink like a smoothie.

[17:05]
I don't understand it. How do you drink a mood?

[17:08]
- Like a smoothie. - So it is a smoothie.

[17:11]
No, it's a smoodie-- A mood that you drink.

[17:14]
- How do you drink a mood? - Like a smoothie.

[17:18]
But do you buy it in a store? What're the physical attributes?

[17:21]
We haven't worked out all the kinks yet,

[17:23]
but the important thing is we've gone public,

[17:25]
and we want you to get in on the ground floor.

[17:28]
See, that's the problem with all your ideas--

[17:29]
they don't have ground floors.

[17:32]
Finally, a Halloween store for the rest of-- Aah!

[17:36]
[thud]

[17:38]
[man] Hello.

[17:39]
Anyway, our launch party's tonight,

[17:42]
- and we'd love it if you came. - We spared no expense...

[17:44]
that's how confident we are in our product.

[17:47]
- Your product-- Smoodies. - Yes.

[17:48]
Wait, did you say smoodies or smoothies?

[17:51]
Because we only make-- Which one do we make?

[17:53]
I'd like to think the smoodies make us.

[17:56]
Ahh, I can tell by your tone that that was something smart.

[18:00]
[hip-hop music]

[18:03]
- Smoodie keychain? - Smoodie cozy?

[18:06]
-Smoodie bottle opener?

[18:07]
It's a mood that you drink like a smoothie.

[18:09]
Todd, it is all happening.

[18:11]
Hooray. And you know I don't throw that word around lightly.

[18:15]
All right. Now we just got to make sure we focus

[18:17]
and actually follow through on this.

[18:19]
I'd feel awful if this great idea fell apart

[18:22]
because we got distracted by something else,

[18:24]
as we are often wont to do.

[18:26]
Wait, did you say you feel awful or falafel?

[18:29]
I said, "Feel awful,"

[18:31]
but tell me more about this falafel idea.

[18:34]
Falafel or fawaffle?

[18:38]
What?

[18:39]
[dance music]

[18:45]
BoJack, isn't this exciting? Smoodies, right?

[18:49]
Do you even know what a smoodie is?

[18:52]
I think it's some kind of an adult onesie.

[18:54]
Whatever it is, I'm trying new things.

[18:56]
I'm single again, and I'm loving it.

[18:58]
- Let me repeat-- - Princess Carolyn.

[19:01]
Vincent. Well, you've got some nerve showing your face.

[19:05]
- I've got half a mind to-- - No, let me talk.

[19:08]
I had a attitude problem,

[19:11]
but then I took a timeout,

[19:13]
and I thought about what I did.

[19:15]
I wanted to be a big man.

[19:17]
But sometimes the biggest thing a man can do is tell the truth.

[19:22]
And the truth about me is, I... I--

[19:26]
- Okay, here we go. - I love you.

[19:28]
- What? - Oh, Vincent.

[19:30]
Let's go feel grass between our toes.

[19:33]
- What? - All right.

[19:35]
You're a better man than I could ever be.

[19:37]
I wish my boyfriend was that mature.

[19:39]
- [groans] - [cell phone vibrates]

[19:41]
- Hello? - BoJack, it's Kelsey Jannings.

[19:43]
I got some news about "Secretariat."

[19:45]
- What's up? - Garfield's out.

[19:47]
He got into some sort of accident.

[19:49]
An All Hallows' Eve store in January?

[19:51]
How fiendishly droll. Aah!

[19:54]
[thud]

[19:56]
Oh, bother.

[19:57]
The clumsy bastard broke every bone in his body,

[20:00]
and now we got to find a new lead.

[20:01]
Studio wants to go young, but I was thinking we'd get

[20:04]
someone a little more BoJack Horseman.

[20:07]
What? Are you serious?

[20:09]
You're the only one with enough grit to play the part,

[20:11]
and we can age you down in post, but I'm gonna tell you now,

[20:13]
not gonna put up with any woe-is-me bullshit

[20:15]
or diva histrionics.

[20:17]
I get enough of that from my ex-wife

[20:19]
along with newspaper clippings about gluten.

[20:21]
God, we get it, Marla. Gluten.

[20:23]
But if you want to make a movie, and you're ready to work...

[20:26]
I am. I will. I can. I do.

[20:28]
Great. You got one month to get in shape.

[20:30]
You need to lose 50 pounds and then gain back 20.

[20:32]
- And, BoJack... - Yeah?

[20:34]
Don't ever call this number.

[20:36]
If I want to talk, I'll call you.

[20:37]
[cell phone beeps]

[20:41]
- Hey. - Hey.

[20:44]
Not big on parties, huh?

[20:45]
Nah. I never know what to do with my hands.

[20:48]
I think I just got cast in Secretariat.

[20:50]
- That's amazing. - It's everything I ever wanted.

[20:53]
- Yeah, you seem super-jazzed. - What do I do now?

[20:57]
Well, that's the problem with life, right?

[20:59]
Either you know what you want, and you don't get what you want,

[21:02]
or get what you want, and then you don't know what you want.

[21:04]
- Well, that's stupid. - Yeah.

[21:07]
I don't know if this makes you more or less excited,

[21:09]
but I actually decided to take a job on the Secretariat movie

[21:12]
as a character consultant.

[21:14]
Wow, so we're gonna be working together again.

[21:17]
Yeah. I hope you don't get sick of me.

[21:19]
I don't think that's gonna happen.

[21:20]
- Is it weird I took this job? - Why would it be weird?

[21:23]
You literally wrote the book on Secretariat.

[21:26]
Yeah, I know. I just-- When I first moved to L.A...

[21:29]
I thought I was gonna be doing really important work.

[21:32]
You know, writing stuff that makes a difference.

[21:35]
But then you kind of fall into one thing and then another...

[21:38]
Well, you've got time. There's always later, right?

[21:40]
Yeah, I guess there's always later.

[21:42]
Do you remember the last time I saw you?

[21:44]
You asked me if I thought you were a good person deep down?

[21:47]
Do I remember that? Yeah, vaguely.

[21:50]
You caught me off guard. I didn't know what to say.

[21:52]
Well, do you think I'm a good person... deep down?

[21:56]
That's the thing. I don't think I believe in deep down.

[21:59]
I kind of think all you are is just the things that you do.

[22:03]
- Well, that's depressing. - [laughs]

[22:06]
For what it's worth,

[22:07]
I think your writing does make a difference.

[22:09]
Thanks.

[22:11]
I really wanted you to like me, Diane.

I know.

I got so distracted by trying to get tickets

to the New Kids On The Block concert,

[23:23]
I completely lost sight of what's important.

[23:26]
And I got so swept up in my campaign for class president,

I forgot why I was running in the first place.
