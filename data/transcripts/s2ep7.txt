[00:10]
[crowd cheering]

[00:11]
Thank you, Billy Crystal, for that impression of a black person.

[00:14]
-I'm Scott Wolf. -And I'm Matthew Fox.

[00:17]
We may be a group of five on TV,

[00:19]
but any of these next nominees would be welcome

[00:22]
to join our party any day.

[00:24]
-[microphone feedback] -[man coughs]

[00:26]
The nominees for Male Animal in a Comedy, Drama or Variety Show are:

[00:31]
BoJack Horseman, Horsin' Around.

[00:34]
Now that's what I call horsin' around.

[00:37]
[audience laughs and applauds]

[00:38]
Uh... Yeah.

[00:40]
Mr. Peanutbutter, Mr. Peanutbutter's House.

[00:44]
Now that's what I call doggin' around.

[00:46]
[audience laughs and applauds]

[00:48]
[laughs]

[00:49]
And finally, my personal favorite,

[00:51]
Hank Hippopopalous, Hank After Dark!

[00:55]
Oh, boy, get it off, get it off.

[00:58]
-[baby shrieks] -[audience laughs and applauds]

[01:00]
Hiya!

[01:02]
And the animals' choice is...

[01:04]
Hank Hippopopalous, Hank After Dark!

[01:07]
[Wolf howls]

[01:08]
Oh, yeah.

[01:09]
[camera shutters clicking]

[01:11]
No, no, no, no. It's because we're on a show

[01:13]
called Party of Five. Get it?

[01:16]
Hey, buddy, pass me that bottle of vodka?

[01:18]
-That's not really how this works. -It's open bar, don't be a dick.

[01:21]
-BoJack Horseman? -Do I know you?

[01:23]
This is my better half, Katrina Peanutbutter.

[01:26]
-Katrina, BoJack. -I don't watch TV.

[01:28]
Can I get another drink now or will that quote, unquote "embarrass" you?

[01:32]
-Uh, uh, no, I would never be-- -Erica! Throw me a raft. I'm dying.

[01:36]
My friends told me to get a prenup,

[01:38]
but I was like, "Hey, marriage lasts forever."

[01:42]
Listen, I'm doing my own thing here.

[01:44]
Can you believe two guys like us

[01:46]
were even in the same category as Hank Hippopopalous?

[01:50]
[chuckles] That's Uncle Hanky.

[01:51]
Listen, Peanutbottle, there is no "guys like us."

[01:54]
I'm BoJack Horseman.

[01:56]
You're just some other guy I'll probably never talk to again.

[01:58]
Hey, boys. What is this, a crossover episode?

[02:02]
[all laugh]

[02:03]
That is the funniest thing I have ever heard.

[02:06]
Uncle Hanky. Sir, I am your biggest fan.

[02:09]
I used to watch Hank Hippopopalous's Dance-Pop Cosmopolis

[02:12]
every day after school.

[02:14]
-Hey, can I get a picture with you? -Of course, kid.

[02:17]
Here, let me advance this. [grunts] And we probably got it.

[02:21]
And we'll find out in four to six weeks.

[02:23]
Yeah, I can't wait.

[02:24]
Okay, I gotta go. My wife's hand just disappeared

[02:27]
into that busboy's pants.

[02:28]
Treasure? Sweetheart? We're in public.

[02:31]
Hey, kid, listen.

[02:33]
Don't beat yourself up too bad.

[02:34]
I've seen your show. You're really funny.

[02:37]
-Yeah? -Yeah. But I'm Uncle Hanky.

[02:40]
You can't beat Uncle Hanky.

[02:42]
That's just the way it is.

[02:45]
Oh.

[02:47]
This suit needs more flasks.

[02:51]
[♪♪]

[03:51]
-Diane! -[passenger] Aah!

[03:53]
Will you bring me one of those big Toblerone bars? [chuckles]

[03:57]
Well, sure. But, you know, I won't be out there for another month.

[04:01]
Yes, I know, but I always forget to write these things down.

[04:04]
Tell me, how's your little movie?

[04:06]
Actually one of the stars just died. It's really sad.

[04:10]
Oh, really? One person died? Just one?

[04:12]
Yeah, well, that's a real tragedy. Meanwhile, Diane,

[04:15]
here in Cordovia, I'm stitching children's arms back on.

[04:18]
Oh, that's backwards, isn't it?

[04:20]
Are you giving me a thumb's up or a thumb's down? I can't tell.

[04:24]
Well, now the production's on hiatus

[04:26]
so BoJack and I are going on a book tour

[04:28]
to promote the new paperback edition of One Trick Pony.

[04:31]
Please get here soon, Diane.

[04:32]
The people of Cordovia need you and I need that Toblerone.

[04:38]
Okay, listen, you big dummy.

[04:40]
You need to be on your best behavior for this tour.

[04:42]
Don't do that BoJack thing where you go off-script

[04:45]
and get a lot of people mad at you.

[04:47]
What? I don't do that.

[04:49]
You're a movie star now.

[04:50]
Any bad press you get can hurt Secretariat.

[04:53]
Now boarding, Flight 422 to Juneau.

[04:57]
Please. We're going to Alaska.

[04:59]
How am I gonna offend a bunch of inbred Eskimo blubber-munchers?

[05:01]
You're right. What was I thinking?

[05:04]
The Republic of Cordovia's Prince Gustav

[05:06]
visiting Los Angeles this week

[05:08]
while his country rests on the brink of civil war.

[05:11]
Prince Gustav is a ruthless despot,

[05:13]
but I'd still rather share a bed with him than my ex-wife.

[05:16]
Shannon, I didn't mean that.

[05:21]
[dance music playing over speakers]

[05:24]
Listen. With Hey, I Think You Can Dance as a lead-in,

[05:26]
we are expecting big things for Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities:

[05:29]
What Do They Know? Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out,

[05:31]
or H.S.A.C.W.D.T.K.D.T.K.T.L.F.O. for short.

[05:36]
-Mm. -[Wanda] Why don't we get Hank in here?

[05:38]
You guys can get some pictures together.

[05:40]
Hank is coming here?

[05:42]
That old guy from Hey, I Think You Can Dance?

[05:44]
-What's the big deal? -You don't understand.

[05:47]
When I was a kid, this guy was the guy.

[05:50]
I even bought his novelty rap album, The Hank Hippopopalous Hip-Hop Hypothesis.

[05:53]
You shouldn't meet your hero on an empty stomach.

[05:56]
-Want me to go get you some chili? -Good call.

[05:58]
Chili is nature's chillaxative.

[05:59]
Hiya, folks! Howdy!

[06:02]
-Hank Hippopopalous. -Oh, we've met.

[06:06]
Oh, oh, yeah. I remember that.

[06:09]
Okay, so, I thought for the ad,

[06:10]
you guys could stand back to back.

[06:12]
And then on the billboard it'll say:

[06:14]
"Hank and Mr. Peanutbutter are back to back. Thursdays on MBN." [laughs]

[06:19]
So, what should I do with my arms? Like akimbo?

[06:22]
-You're fine. -Reverse akimbo?

[06:23]
-No, that-- -King Tut? Mashed Potato? Windmill?

[06:25]
Uh-oh, I'm windmilling. Got a momentum going.

[06:28]
-Can't stop windmilling now. -Hey, hey.

[06:29]
Why don't we just do what feels natural?

[06:32]
Guys like us? We're pros.

[06:34]
"Guys like us"?

[06:35]
You think I'm a guy like us?

[06:37]
Oh, this is the happiest moment of my life.

[06:40]
Excuse me, would you get a picture of us?

[06:41]
Yeah, that's kind of the idea.

[06:45]
Now we open the floor to questions from the audience.

[06:49]
BoJack, your book talked a lot about how much you love apple fritters.

[06:53]
Yeah, thanks for that, Diane.

[06:55]
So, my question is:

[06:56]
Do you think Israel has a right to defend herself?

[06:59]
-Uh... -And what part should the U.S. play

[07:01]
as an ally?

[07:02]
[groans]

[07:03]
Well, the thing about that...

[07:05]
[both growl]

[07:07]
Uh... It's a shame that Arafat walked away from the table in 2000.

[07:11]
I mean, obviously there's no panacea, but a two-state solution

[07:14]
with an emphasis on human rights feels like a place to begin.

[07:16]
[audience murmuring]

[07:17]
-[Moose] Brilliant insight. -[woman] Very good.

[07:20]
-My question is for Diane Nyu-- Nyu-- -Oh.

[07:22]
- Nyu-- -You won't get it. Ask the question.

[07:25]
Your book went to some revealing places.

[07:26]
Were you worried at all that it would hurt BoJack or his career?

[07:29]
That's a great question.

[07:31]
I'd also like to know the answer to that, Diane.

[07:33]
Well, I think the truth is worth pursuing, no matter what.

[07:37]
BoJack's not perfect. There are other celebrities

[07:39]
who have done much worse things and it hasn't hurt their careers.

[07:43]
-Like who? -I don't know, like Mike Tyson

[07:45]
or... Sean Penn, or Josh Brolin, or Christian Slater, Woody Allen,

[07:50]
Hank Hippopopalous, Bill Murray...

[07:53]
Wait, wait, what about Hank Hippopopalous?

[07:56]
Well, all of his former assistants have made the same allegations.

[07:59]
-I feel like we're getting off track. -Do you not know that?

[08:01]
Any questions about me, the handsome, famous horse with a book?

[08:04]
What do you have against Uncle Hanky?

[08:06]
I'm not saying anything not on the public record.

[08:08]
You can just Google "Hank Hippopopalous allegations" and I--

[08:10]
Oh, you don't have to Google it right now.

[08:12]
[all gasp]

[08:13]
Dear God.

[08:15]
Stanky Hanky? Allegations vile and ranky.

[08:18]
But first, the visiting Cordovian Prince Gustav

[08:21]
went missing briefly this afternoon,

[08:23]
but he was quickly found buying chili in Beverly Hills.

[08:27]
His official statement was, "Uh, yeah, I'm the Prince of Cordovia.

[08:31]
Hooray, being a prince."

[08:33]
Our main story, ominous and anomalous accusations

[08:36]
against Hank Hippopopalous.

[08:38]
Who is this anonymous Diane Nguyen

[08:40]
and what does she have against our beloved hippopotamus?

[08:43]
Joining me now is Hippopopalous apologist

[08:45]
and armchair sociologist, Cardigan Burke. Cardigan,

[08:47]
what are these allegations?

[08:49]
These allegations are so crazy, I can't even say them on TV

[08:52]
or I'll sound like a crazy person.

[08:54]
What I want to know is why we're letting a national treasure

[08:56]
face the same kind of smear tactics used by the Viet Cong.

[09:00]
Are you calling attention to the fact

[09:01]
that Ms. Nguyen is Vietnamese?

[09:04]
I'd like to think that's a coincidence.

[09:09]
[Peanutbutter] You gotta see this set they're building!

[09:11]
There's a giant replica of my head,

[09:13]
and every episode, the eyes light up with dollar signs,

[09:15]
confetti shoots out of the ears, then I somersault out the mouth.

[09:19]
We're bringing class back to primetime.

[09:21]
-Sounds amazing. -And I'm really getting along

[09:23]
with J.D. Salinger.

[09:25]
-Did you know we both hate phonies? -I did know that.

[09:28]
So... listen. Some website called "Tit Puncher"

[09:31]
is saying you said some stuff about Hank Hippopopalous.

[09:35]
Oh, my God, Mr. Peanutbutter, I didn't mean for that to happen.

[09:37]
Hey, do me a favor. Please don't make a big thing out of this.

[09:41]
It's really not a good time, you know, with my show about to launch.

[09:44]
-Hey, we are on the same page. -Oh, are you also on "Tit Puncher"?

[09:47]
Because you should not read the comments.

[09:49]
Believe me, nothing would make me happier

[09:51]
than for this to just go away.

[09:53]
-Great. I love you, too. -[with heavy accent] Hello.

[09:56]
-Oh, my God! -Is chili you ask for.

[09:58]
I am peasant boy Todd from village.

[10:00]
Friend of Peanut Man, and lover of federated American states.

[10:03]
No reason for suspicions. [laughs] Come on!

[10:07]
Wait a second, something's different. [sniffs]

[10:10]
I am... digging this new cologne!

[10:13]
You smell like a fancy cabbage.

[10:15]
Is so great to be in meager trash city Los Angeles

[10:18]
with no pressures of royal life.

[10:21]
What? Royal life? Why I'm saying? I am no royal.

[10:24]
[chuckles] Look at me. Normals.

[10:26]
There's that classic self-deprecating Todd wit.

[10:29]
I'd know it anywhere.

[10:34]
-We will now begin our Q and A. -Fire when ready.

[10:37]
What you got against Uncle Hanky, you uppity cooze?

[10:41]
Diane, I believe this question is for you.

[10:42]
If anyone here has any questions about the book,

[10:44]
I'd be happy to answer those.

[10:46]
As would I, BoJack Horseman,

[10:47]
Golden-Globe winning star of the book.

[10:50]
If Hank did anything wrong, they wouldn't let him on TV, right?

[10:53]
I'm really not here to talk about that.

[10:55]
You women are all the same.

[10:57]
-Excuse me? -Yeah, you make these

[10:59]
broad accusations to get attention for yourself,

[11:01]
and when you don't have proof to back it up, you just slink away.

[11:04]
I'm not slinking away.

[11:06]
I just wanted to say one thing about me.

[11:08]
I text and drive like all the time. What?

[11:11]
Isn't that what happened with all those assistants? They took his money,

[11:15]
and they don't even care they could be ruining a man's life.

[11:17]
What? They ruined his life?

[11:20]
-You should probably just drop this. -Oh, I'm gonna drop it, all right.

[11:23]
They don't even know how much I'm gonna drop it.

[11:25]
The way you said that made it sound like you won't drop it.

[11:29]
How dare you spread a narrative that--

[11:31]
Don't tell me what to spread.

[11:32]
I'll spread whatever I want. It's called one of the amendments.

[11:35]
Ladies, please! Don't get hysterical!

[11:37]
-This is completely-- -Yeah, hi.

[11:39]
I'm Diane's friend, BoJack.

[11:41]
I came with her. I gotta say I'm opposed to child labor,

[11:44]
like as a rule, but there are some kinds of labor

[11:46]
that children are just better at.

[11:48]
You ever try to fit into a mine shaft?

[11:50]
That is a tight squeeze. What?

[11:53]
Oh, man, probably gonna get some letters about that, huh?

[11:55]
I'm so incorrigible.

[11:57]
Everyone's paying attention to me now!

[11:59]
Okay, I'm gonna go get a snack.

[12:01]
Anyone else want a snack?

[12:03]
No? That's a no? On the snacks? Okay.

[12:07]
What do you have against Hank Hippopopalous?

[12:09]
Everyone says he's a really nice guy.

[12:11]
Good point.

[12:12]
That's exactly the problem. Because he's so nice,

[12:14]
people don't wanna think he's capable of awful things

[12:17]
so they let him off the hook.

[12:18]
We don't know what happened. It's a classic "he said, she said."

[12:21]
"He said, they said." It's eight different women.

[12:25]
-Are they all lying? -I mean, probably. We do that.

[12:28]
At this point, we just don't know enough to judge.

[12:31]
Who are these women? Have they ever shoplifted perhaps?

[12:33]
Do they wear short shorts?

[12:34]
Do they drink alcohol? All these things are possible.

[12:37]
We don't know the facts.

[12:38]
See, this is part of the problem.

[12:40]
You're supposed to be a journalist.

[12:41]
You won't even tell your audience what he's accused of.

[12:44]
You're an expert. Why don't you tell us?

[12:46]
I'm not afraid to say it.

[12:47]
Eight different women, all former assistants,

[12:50]
claim that Uncle Hanky took them to a--

[12:53]
What is Diane doing?

[12:54]
I know. It's supposed to be my book tour and she's upstaging me.

[12:57]
Like how it was supposed to be my book.

[12:59]
Actually, this might be a thing she does.

[13:01]
She knows that Hippopopalous is the only thing

[13:03]
keeping my network afloat, right?

[13:05]
The same network that employs her husband.

[13:07]
Why would she do this?

[13:08]
Sometimes she just whips herself into a frenzy

[13:10]
and she loses all perspective. Goddamn it, honeydew?!

[13:13]
Jesus, why does cantaloupe think every time it gets invited to a party,

[13:16]
it can bring along its dumb friend honeydew?

[13:18]
You don't get a plus-one, cantaloupe!

[13:20]
You need to talk to her.

[13:22]
Huh.

[13:24]
Wanda, I just got back from a set visit on Contemporary Family.

[13:27]
It's a disaster!

[13:28]
-What? -The kids have gone through puberty.

[13:30]
They are rubbing themselves on everything.

[13:33]
If it isn't one thing, it's ano-- Just get a hose!

[13:40]
Aha! I went to house to pick up mail for you like real American Johnny.

[13:45]
-Hey, man. -Whoa!

[13:47]
You know it's a federal crime to go through someone else's mail?

[13:50]
I do not know your customs, for I am dirt-poor servant child.

[13:56]
Oh, don't worry about it. Now walk me through that mail.

[13:58]
Death threat for wife, death threat for wife, once more death threat,

[14:02]
and here many monies off for Bed Bath Beyond.

[14:06]
Seems like great U.S.A. dream castle!

[14:09]
Good Lord, that's graphic.

[14:11]
How would she even fit one of those in there?

[14:13]
Some sort of funnel. Oh, I see, there's actually an illustration.

[14:16]
Excuse, Dog Dog Peanut Man? This wife, she poke bear, yes?

[14:21]
Yeah, I guess she kind of did.

[14:23]
They have a saying where I am from, which is here.

[14:27]
Bear not like to be poke.

[14:29]
-Bear get angry... -Right.

[14:31]
and destroy peasant rebel army

[14:34]
with fist of fire of which make many, many nightmares

[14:39]
to children and men!

[14:41]
Todd, I can always count on you to give me the straight dope.

[14:45]
Please don't ever change.

[14:47]
[inaudible dialogue]

[14:48]
[women gasp]

[14:49]
Okay, just kill the whole feature. Replace it with-- Oh, I don't know.

[14:52]
What's Gwyneth doing for Purim?

[14:54]
Diane? I want you to meet Amanda Hannity,

[14:56]
editor-in-chief here at Manatee Fair.

[14:58]
The pleasure's yours. Walk with me, squawk with me.

[15:00]
That woman can knock a drink back like a Kennedy at a wake for another Kennedy,

[15:04]
but damn if she doesn't get shit done.

[15:06]
No. Yes. Turtleneck. You're fired.

[15:09]
Um, okay, I wanted to pitch you an exposé on Hank Hippopopalous.

[15:12]
I would love to take down Hippopopalous

[15:14]
and finally topple the acropolis of monstrous hypocrisy

[15:17]
that ensconces us.

[15:18]
Hey, wouldn't your readers prefer something more relevant?

[15:21]
Like, uh, what to do with all those extra buttons that come with your shirts.

[15:25]
Amanda, I am so glad you're throwing your weight behind this.

[15:29]
-Oh, I didn't mean-- -That dress is hideous.

[15:31]
Go home, burn it and come back.

[15:33]
When we know what we know about a monster like that

[15:35]
and we still put him on TV every week,

[15:37]
we're teaching a generation of young boys and girls

[15:39]
that a man's reputation is more important

[15:41]
than the lives of the women he's ruined.

[15:43]
Yes, exactly! I feel like I've been alone

[15:45]
in a crazy alternate universe these last few days.

[15:48]
Well, you know I got your back, right?

[15:49]
We women have got to stick to-- Hey, fruit plate.

[15:52]
No, people don't want articles about that. People want life-hacks.

[15:55]
Diane, you need to be strong.

[15:57]
Everyone is gunning for you. You're a woman talking out of turn about a man.

[16:01]
We're not supposed to have opinions. We're supposed to smile and look pretty.

[16:05]
No, this model doesn't look as pretty as the other one. Can we kill it?

[16:08]
Scarves, not just for necks anymo--

[16:10]
We need to sit you down with someone who's willing to go on the record.

[16:14]
I already reached out to all eight of Hank's former assistants. Nothing.

[16:17]
-What about his current assistant? -You think she'd talk?

[16:19]
I don't know. What do you think, answering machine?

[16:21]
[beeps]

[16:22]
Hi, my name's Nicole. I work for Mr. Hippopopalous and, um...

[16:27]
I really need to talk to someone.

[16:29]
[gasps]

[16:30]
Are you kidding me? With this honeydew right now? Ugh!

[16:45]
-Nicole? -Mm-hm.

[16:48]
[car door opens]

[16:49]
[Hank] Hello, Diane.

[16:52]
Thank you, Nicole.

[16:59]
Prince Gustav today startled the international community

[17:03]
when he gave his royal fortune to charity.

[17:06]
What? Oh, no!

[17:08]
And fired his chief advisor, who can be seen in this file photo

[17:10]
looking vaguely suspicious.

[17:12]
Oh, you idiot! No!

[17:14]
Big reforms which could lead to sweeping change

[17:16]
in the embattled region, or a precipitous economic collapse.

[17:20]
[shouting in Cordovian]

[17:22]
But back to our main story, what is Diane's problem?

[17:30]
I'll say it once, for your article.

[17:31]
I didn't do any of those things that you're accusing me of.

[17:37]
I wanna be very clear.

[17:39]
I'm not meeting you here because I'm scared of you.

[17:41]
This is me doing you a favor.

[17:43]
-I think you are scared of me. -I'm not a bad guy, Diane,

[17:46]
and I truly do believe that.

[17:47]
Twenty-four hours from now,

[17:49]
the news cycle will move on to something else.

[17:52]
I'll go back to hosting my dance show,

[17:54]
which employs hundreds of nice, good, hardworking people.

[17:57]
You, on the other hand, are pretty much done.

[18:01]
People love me and they're not gonna forgive you for this.

[18:04]
-This isn't about me. -If you keep pushing this,

[18:06]
you're gonna drag down the people close to you.

[18:09]
Look, you had your fun.

[18:11]
So, why don't you call it a day and go home to your husband?

[18:14]
I know who you are.

[18:15]
Sweetheart, everyone knows who I am.

[18:18]
I'm Hank Hippopopalous.

[18:21]
Who the hell are you?

[18:30]
-So, you got nothing. -I'm not giving up.

[18:32]
There's gotta be someone who will talk.

[18:34]
Oh, listen. I had a conversation with my bosses

[18:37]
at AOL-Time Warner-Pepsico- Viacom-Halliburton-Skynet-

[18:40]
Toyota-Trader Joe's, and we agreed

[18:43]
these kind of stories, they don't sell magazines.

[18:46]
-Are you seriously killing this? -It's just not a good time.

[18:49]
So, this has nothing to do with the fact

[18:51]
that AOL-Time Warner-Pepsico-

[18:53]
Viacom-Halliburton-Skynet-Toyota- Trader Joe's also owns MBN,

[18:57]
and is currently profiting off of Hank Hippopopalous's good reputation?

[19:01]
I know you're upset.

[19:02]
Would you like a Joe-Joe?

[19:03]
It's just like an Oreo, but Trader Joe's style.

[19:06]
No, I don't want a Joe-Joe.

[19:08]
Because you're mad at me, right?

[19:09]
Not because Joe-Joes taste like garbage?

[19:18]
So, help me to understand...

[19:19]
Dog friend's program is to find what celebrities know?

[19:23]
-Yep. -So, is torture?

[19:26]
We don't torture people in America, Todd.

[19:29]
That's called one of the amendments.

[19:31]
No, of course.

[19:32]
In America, you do not know to suffer.

[19:36]
You eat your cheesy pizza, you drink your ade of gator.

[19:40]
This life is nice for visit but no way for live.

[19:44]
I go now. Back to palace!

[19:47]
[shouting in Cordovian]

[19:49]
Sounds great, Todd. See you tomorrow.

[19:55]
So, they hated the skorts idea, huh?

[19:57]
No, I didn't pitch your skorts idea.

[19:59]
[man 1] Hey, Diane!

[20:00]
Why don't you shut your stupid ugly face?!

[20:02]
Don't you talk to her like that!

[20:04]
[man 2] Yeah, don't listen to that guy, Diane.

[20:06]
I say you should shut your stupid pretty face.

[20:09]
-This is not over. When people hear what-- -Give it a rest. It's over. You lost.

[20:13]
-How could you say that? -What are you doing here?

[20:15]
I mean, what is your endgame in all of this?

[20:18]
You don't actually believe Hank's innocent, do you?

[20:22]
Of course not, but that doesn't matter.

[20:24]
You're not gonna beat this guy.

[20:26]
I--

[20:27]
[grunting]

[20:28]
-What? -Todd?

[20:29]
BoJack! Thank God you found me.

[20:31]
I thought I would never see you again.

[20:33]
-We're in the middle of something. -I got mixed up in some bad stuff

[20:37]
and a genocide may or may not have been perpetrated in my name.

[20:41]
Maybe you heard about it on the news?

[20:43]
No, most of the news has been about Diane and Hank Hippopopalous.

[20:47]
What? Why? This is really serious.

[20:49]
Oh, of course your thing is serious

[20:51]
and my thing is just a dumb feminist trying to get attention

[20:53]
by attacking a famous man, is that it?

[20:55]
Uh, what? No.

[20:57]
-Eat shit, Diane! -You eat shit!

[20:59]
Diane, obviously Todd doesn't know what you're talking about.

[21:02]
He spent the last few days at Burning Man or whatever getting high.

[21:04]
No! That's not what happened at all.

[21:06]
A stranger just told me to eat shit.

[21:09]
I don't understand why you can't be on my side about this.

[21:11]
I am on your side.

[21:12]
And I'm telling you you're not gonna win this thing.

[21:15]
Also, P.S., when have you ever been on my side?

[21:18]
-I am always on your side. -Really?

[21:20]
Like when you wrote that book? Was that you being on my side?

[21:23]
You're not still mad about the book.

[21:25]
You manipulated me and completely took advantage of--

[21:28]
Guys? There is a very fragile alliance

[21:30]
between the Cords and the Ovians.

[21:32]
If we don't do something--

[21:34]
-Todd, nobody cares. -Nobody cares, Todd.

[21:35]
Everything I did was to help you tell the story

[21:38]
I knew you wanted to tell.

[21:41]
You got everything you wanted because of that book.

[21:43]
You were a joke, now people take you seriously.

[21:46]
You were out of work, now you got your dream role.

[21:49]
Okay, yes. All of that is true.

[21:50]
But also, you were my friend and you hurt my feelings.

[21:54]
And it's weird that you never apologized for that...

[21:57]
and that you still won't.

[21:58]
Well... [quietly] I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.

[22:04]
-Are you? -Yes, actually. I am.

[22:08]
I didn't want to do that

[22:09]
and I probably could have handled things better.

[22:12]
I definitely should have. I'm sorry.

[22:17]
Okay.

[22:18]
But this is bigger than you and me.

[22:19]
And I need you in my corner now because I don't have anybody else.

[22:24]
[sighs]

[22:25]
Well, okay.

[22:27]
-Yeah? -Yeah.

[22:30]
I'm in your corner.

[22:32]
Guys, earlier, some general asked me if it was "a go"

[22:37]
...on "that thing we talked about"?

[22:39]
And I said, "Yes." And he said, "God help us all" and left the room.

[22:43]
Now I'm not sure that was the right answer.

[22:48]
So, then I called Wayne to see

[22:49]
if I could write a story for Buzzfeed. Here's the good news:

[22:51]
They'll publish anything.

[22:53]
Hey, um...

[22:55]
Can I talk to you?

[22:56]
Yeah, of course. What's up?

[22:57]
I asked you, really nicely, not to make a big thing out of this.

[23:03]
-Yeah, I know, but someone-- -Had to say something, right?

[23:07]
And that someone had to be you?

[23:10]
Because... why?

[23:12]
I really don't get it.

[23:14]
What is accomplished by you being the one to take a stand on this?

[23:18]
-Uh... -[sighs]

[23:19]
Mr. Peanutbutter--

[23:20]
This game show is a really big deal for me.

[23:24]
And I know that sounds stupid to you, and small.

[23:27]
But I need this to go well, and I can't... [sighs]

[23:31]
Those are death threats.

[23:32]
People want to murder my wife

[23:34]
because of what she's saying on the news

[23:36]
about something that she has nothing to do with.

[23:39]
"You can't. You stupid, ugly can't."

[23:42]
-Yeah, that doesn't say "can't." -Oh.

[23:44]
God, you know, you'd almost be safer in Cordovia.

[23:49]
Yeah, maybe I should go to Cordovia.

[23:51]
I'm obviously not making a difference here.

[23:53]
Actually, maybe you should.

[23:55]
Go feel good about yourself and do your important work.

[24:00]
And maybe some space might be good for us.

[24:04]
You don't really want me to go, do you?

[24:09]
Why does it suddenly matter what I want?

[24:18]
[man over PA] Flight 57, Cordovian Airlines, now boarding.

[24:21]
Hank, I have to ask, did you do it?

[24:24]
No, I did not.

[24:26]
Well, that's good enough for me.

[24:28]
Coming up, Kanye West claims to hate Thin Mints. Our panel is outraged.

[24:33]
Hating Thin Mints? Is he legally insane?

[24:36]
You can bet we'll get into this further in the next hour.

[24:39]
This is the only thing I care about now.

[24:43]
[man] Hey.

[24:45]
Smile.
