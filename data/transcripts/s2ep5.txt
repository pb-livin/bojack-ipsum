[00:08]
Son, did you do your homework?

[00:10]
I don't wanna do my homework!

[00:12]
What, what, what?

[00:14]
-I want Chicken 4 Dayz! -Oh...

[00:16]
[rapper] ♪ Oh, it's Chicken 4 Dayz! ♪

[00:18]
♪ It's Chicken 4 Dayz! ♪

[00:19]
♪ Everybody's having fun At Chicken 4 Dayz! ♪

[00:22]
-I got a drumstick! -I got a arm.

[00:25]
I got a bucket full of mystery stuff!

[00:27]
[rapper] ♪ Chicken-4-Dayzy, totally crazy! ♪

[00:30]
♪ Don't ask questions, just keep eating! ♪

[00:33]
Over at Chicken 4 Dayz,

[00:35]
they pump their chickens full of hormones

[00:37]
and keep them cooped up in tiny cages.

[00:40]
Now, as a chicken, this concerns me.

[00:43]
Here at Gentle Farms, we treat our livestock differently.

[00:46]
Lush fields, plenty of dignity,

[00:48]
and foosball. [chuckles]

[00:51]
The chickens here have wonderful lives

[00:53]
before we harvest them, so you can eat them.

[00:56]
But wait, Pa, aren't we chickens?

[00:58]
I don't wanna get eaten!

[01:00]
Boy, these animals aren't like us.

[01:02]
They're specifically bred to be eaten,

[01:04]
and genetically modified for maximum flavor.

[01:08]
When our chicks first hatch, we lovingly inject them

[01:11]
with natural delicious hormones,

[01:14]
which makes them meat, thereby erasing any moral gray area!

[01:18]
Now you can feel good about eating our meat.

[01:20]
It's simple: No one knows chicken like chickens.

[01:24]
Gentle Farms.

[01:27]
Why put the "Skip Ad" button so late? I'm not skipping now. I'm invested.

[01:31]
BoJack, you're driving a car right now.

[01:33]
-Oh, right! -Aah! Oh!

[01:35]
[BoJack] Whoa!

[01:36]
[tires screech, then crashing]

[01:40]
[horn honks]

[01:46]
[clucking]

[01:48]
[clucking]

[01:55]
[♪♪]

[02:51]
[cawing]

[02:55]
Kelsey, ray of sunshine.

[02:56]
And who's this little drop of Jupiter?

[02:59]
-This is my daughter, Irving. -Your daughter's name is Irving?

[03:02]
Gender-normative names are oppressive.

[03:04]
Well, aren't you a little princess?

[03:05]
What are you doing outside of the castle?

[03:07]
Mom, your friend is being weird.

[03:09]
BoJack is not my friend.

[03:11]
-Whoa! -Diane, I need you to handle Irving.

[03:14]
-Handle her? -It's Take Your Daughter To Work Day.

[03:16]
I took my daughter to work, she got empowered,

[03:19]
and now I need you to take my daughter away from work,

[03:22]
so I can actually do some.

[03:23]
Mom, don't pawn me off onto your assistant.

[03:25]
Can you not fight me on this, please?

[03:27]
Take my car and my daughter, and go do whatever it is you do.

[03:31]
Way to delegate, captain! Down low!

[03:33]
Nope? Look down. Just put your eyes down.

[03:35]
My hand is below your eye line. No?

[03:38]
I guess you're stuck with me, kiddo.

[03:40]
Sounds great, old-woman-o.

[03:43]
[cell phone chirps]

[03:44]
What is it, BoJack? I'm at my dumb niece's wedding.

[03:47]
Not you, honey! A different dumb niece.

[03:50]
I feel like Kelsey doesn't like me.

[03:51]
You're not really the kind of person people like.

[03:54]
-Right away? -Uh, sure.

[03:56]
But once they get to know me, they adore me?

[03:58]
How do I put this delicately? No.

[04:00]
The problem is we haven't gotten any one-on-one time.

[04:03]
There are always other people around.

[04:05]
Filming me. Feeding me.

[04:06]
Walking me to the garage at night,

[04:08]
because one time I saw a bag in the wind and I got spooked.

[04:11]
BoJack, the only reason you want Kelsey to like you

[04:13]
is because she's cold and distant.

[04:15]
Any time someone tries to love you, you shove them away.

[04:18]
What? No, I don't, stupid. You're stupid.

[04:21]
Don't be such a dumb stupid idiot, Todd.

[04:23]
Okay, I gotta go. Everyone's staring at me for some reason.

[04:26]
What? I'm ready. Let's take a picture.

[04:30]
Hear ye! Hear ye!

[04:32]
I call this meeting of P.B. Livin' to order.

[04:36]
I believe it was Benjamin Franklin who said:

[04:38]
"You have reached the end of your free trial membership

[04:41]
at Benjamin-Franklin-Quotes.com."

[04:43]
-What a wise man. -What's on the agenda, my frienda?

[04:46]
Well, here's an idea.

[04:48]
What if there was a West Dakota?

[04:52]
Todd, isn't that a job for the State Department?

[04:55]
Well, I got a whole page of other ideas,

[04:57]
each as impractical as they are prohibitively expensive.

[05:00]
You know what they say:

[05:02]
"You gotta spend money to make money."

[05:04]
So, how can I spend a lot of money?

[05:06]
I know. I'll take a spa day.

[05:08]
-Uh-- -Eyes, prepare to receive cucumbers.

[05:10]
-We're in a meeting. -You know what they say:

[05:12]
"You gotta skip meetings to have meetings." See ya.

[05:15]
-Wait, what should I do? -I don't know.

[05:17]
Oh, maybe you could go on one of your silly Todd adventures.

[05:21]
You know, whatever you do when everyone is busy with other stuff.

[05:23]
[sighs] Okay.

[05:26]
[cell phone chirps]

[05:27]
What is it, Todd?

[05:28]
Princess Carolyn, I need something to do.

[05:30]
A job, or a task, or a direction in life...

[05:33]
You're my agent. Can you give my life meaning?

[05:35]
I don't have time for this.

[05:37]
Well, don't stop on my account.

[05:39]
Princess Carolyn, do I have a purpose?

[05:42]
Oh, purpose? Are you high?

[05:44]
Only the normal amount.

[05:46]
I gotta go. They're about to step on the glass.

[05:48]
Just stay out of trouble.

[05:51]
[clucks]

[05:52]
Uh, okay.

[05:55]
-[horn honks] -[siren whoops]

[05:57]
[sniffing]

[05:58]
What I want is a hard target search

[06:01]
of every gas station, backyard, outhouse, pool house...

[06:05]
And can I get a black-and-white cookie,

[06:07]
if it's not too G.D. troublesome?

[06:09]
So, we know the chicken crossed the road.

[06:13]
But the real mystery is why?

[06:19]
So, what do you want to be when you grow up?

[06:21]
First I'm gonna go to Brown,

[06:22]
-then I'm gonna go to Yale Law. -Wow.

[06:24]
Then I'm gonna be the youngest Supreme Court Justice.

[06:27]
-That's great. -Or, you know, something in marketing.

[06:30]
Wow.

[06:32]
Would you mind if we stopped by my house?

[06:34]
I have to do laundry.

[06:35]
So, you just, like, do laundry? That's, like, your thing?

[06:39]
Okay. This whole attitude you're putting on?

[06:41]
I must be Shania Twain,

[06:43]
because that don't impress me much.

[06:44]
Is that a reference from the '90s?

[06:46]
You know that was 20 years ago, right?

[06:49]
Hey, I was just like you when I was a teenager.

[06:52]
I was this badass overachiever

[06:55]
that had these big plans to change the world.

[06:57]
Yeah? What happened?

[06:59]
Oh, you didn't hear? I changed the world.

[07:05]
[Todd whistling]

[07:06]
[clucking]

[07:07]
Did you have a nice shower?

[07:10]
I made you a sandwich. Oh, but it has turkey in it.

[07:13]
Is that kind of weird?

[07:14]
-[clucks] -[doorbell rings]

[07:15]
[officer] Police!

[07:17]
-[Todd gulps] -[clucks]

[07:19]
[Todd] Oh, man. [sighs]

[07:21]
What seems to be the problem, Officer...?

[07:23]
Fuzzyface. Meow Meow Fuzzyface.

[07:26]
A Chicken 4 Dayz chicken fell off a truck,

[07:28]
and I gotta find her and take her to the slaughterhouse.

[07:31]
You haven't seen any chickens running around?

[07:33]
No, I don't think so.

[07:34]
[clucking]

[07:37]
-Who's this? -Uh, this is my, uh-- My wife--

[07:41]
-[clucks] -Becca! Yeah, my wife Becca.

[07:43]
-Becca Chavez. There she is. -Okay.

[07:46]
-[clucks] -Yep, she loves her books.

[07:48]
Big reader. [chuckles]

[07:49]
-Real nerd. -[clucks]

[07:51]
Back off? Okay, I'm sorry, honey.

[07:54]
Hold on, if you're really a nerd,

[07:56]
who's your favorite Baroque composer?

[07:59]
[clucks]

[08:00]
-Bach? Not Vivaldi? You're insane! -[clucks]

[08:03]
Yes, I am holding a Bic pen,

[08:05]
but I don't see how that's relevant, Mrs. Chavez.

[08:07]
-[clucks] -Sorry. Becca.

[08:09]
-[clucking] -She's a charming woman.

[08:12]
I do have to look around a little bit, just so I can say I did my job.

[08:16]
-Uh, don't you need a warrant? -Only if you're guilty.

[08:23]
[both chuckling]

[08:24]
Well, in that case, mi casa es su casa.

[08:28]
[both chuckling]

[08:32]
So, if anyone asks, you were born in La Jolla.

[08:34]
You majored in Communications at USC,

[08:36]
and now you're the booking agent

[08:38]
-for Kings of Leon. -[clucks]

[08:40]
-Fine, you also book Beck. -[Diane] Todd?

[08:43]
Aah! I didn't find that thing in your drawer!

[08:45]
Why are the police outside?

[08:47]
Okay. I met this chicken and she escaped from Chicken 4 Dayz factory,

[08:50]
and she doesn't speak English,

[08:51]
but she's my best friend and the cops are looking for her,

[08:54]
and Mr. Peanutbutter went to the spa,

[08:56]
and I love her, and her name is Becca. Chickenson.

[08:59]
-Todd, breathe. -But we can't send Becca back.

[09:02]
-They're gonna pump her full of hormones. -[clucks]

[09:05]
-More hormones. -[clucking]

[09:07]
I have a plan, but we gotta get her out of here now.

[09:10]
-Todd, no. Becca doesn't belong to you. -But she needs our help.

[09:13]
Do you know how much trouble we'd get in?

[09:15]
There's a policeman in our front yard.

[09:17]
Uh-oh, here comes the responsible suburban housewife.

[09:20]
Gonna do whatever the man says.

[09:23]
[sighs]

[09:24]
You're right. Let's get out of here.

[09:26]
So, now you're just gonna do whatever a teenage girl says?

[09:30]
-Jeezy kableezy, grow a spine. -[clucks]

[09:32]
Yeah, or a backbone.

[09:34]
Thank you, Becca.

[09:35]
[groans]

[09:38]
Here chicken, chicken, chicken.

[09:40]
[clucking]

[09:41]
Oh, oh. Well, we're off to the beach.

[09:44]
Just me and my wife, and our teenage daughter and our maid.

[09:48]
-What? Why am I a maid? -Silence, maid!

[09:50]
Honey, do you want to sit in the front or the back?

[09:53]
-[clucks] -And why not? Maid, you can drive.

[09:56]
Hope there's not too much traffic on the 134.

[09:59]
Okay, bye-bye, officer.

[10:01]
So long. Have a great day.

[10:03]
Wait a second. The 134 doesn't go to the beach.

[10:06]
Unless you took it to the 10.

[10:08]
But then why wouldn't you take the 405 to the 10?

[10:11]
Hold on, this pen isn't a Bic.

[10:13]
No, no, this doesn't add up at all.

[10:16]
Wait! That man's wife was a...

[10:19]
chicken!

[10:23]
[news theme music plays]

[10:24]
Fowl run afoul. A funky chicken has flown the coop,

[10:28]
and for a concerned populace, the sky is falling.

[10:31]
Michael Morgan, Chicken 4 Dayz CEO,

[10:33]
this is a public safety hazard, and your company is responsible.

[10:37]
Admit it, you counted your chickens before they hatched,

[10:40]
and now, those chickens have come home to roost.

[10:43]
Tom, I want to take full responsibility for this mishap.

[10:46]
That's why, for a limited time, everybody,

[10:48]
we are offering our special Full Responsibility Poppers

[10:53]
at participating restaurants for only $4.99.

[10:56]
Tell me, though, if one sees

[10:57]
this delicious escaped chicken in the street,

[11:00]
should they approach it, or--?

[11:01]
Oh, no. I want to be very clear that this is not like a friend chicken

[11:05]
you see at school or work.

[11:06]
This is a special kind of food chicken

[11:08]
that has lived its entire life indoors.

[11:11]
This chicken is not socialized for the outside world.

[11:14]
-Sounds like my ex-wife. Hey-yo! -[chuckles]

[11:17]
Oh, Tommy.

[11:18]
Look, the safest place for this chicken right now is with us,

[11:21]
so we can kill it, turn it into a sludge,

[11:24]
and then press that sludge into a delicious patty.

[11:27]
I'd like to take this moment to apologize

[11:29]
for the earlier crack about my ex-wife.

[11:31]
Shannon, we shared 14 beautiful years together.

[11:35]
How do you respond to allegations

[11:37]
that factory farming is "torture," or "cruel,"

[11:41]
or "like a terrifying movie about some strange dystopian society,

[11:44]
but in this monster story, the horrifying monsters are us"?

[11:47]
Relax, Tommy,

[11:49]
everything we do is completely legal and FDA-approved,

[11:53]
so, therefore, it is fine.

[11:55]
I have no follow-up questions.

[12:00]
-Okay, Todd, what's your plan? -What?

[12:03]
You said you had a plan.

[12:04]
Oh, yeah. My plan was: Ask Diane for help.

[12:07]
And now my plan has been completed.

[12:10]
Nice follow-through, Todd.

[12:11]
We have a 'roided out chicken

[12:13]
and the cops on the lookout. What do we do?

[12:15]
Hey, geniuses, why don't we take her to Gentle Farms?

[12:18]
Yeah, no one knows chicken like chickens!

[12:21]
They couldn't say that in the ad if it wasn't true.

[12:25]
-[clucks] -Yeah! Book Beck. You remember.

[12:28]
[Diane groans]

[12:32]
-And cut! Company move to-- -Great news, blue-collar types.

[12:35]
Instead of crew lunch today, your star has arranged

[12:37]
for his favorite burrito truck to bring you lunch.

[12:40]
It's me, I'm that star!

[12:42]
[all cheering]

[12:44]
We're not breaking for lunch yet.

[12:46]
Or we could break for lunch,

[12:47]
and you and I could get to know each other.

[12:49]
The crew has more work to do.

[12:51]
Once they've had a burrito, they'll be off their circadian rhythm--

[12:53]
[cell phone rings]

[12:54]
-What? -Los Angeles P.D.

[12:56]
Are you the owner of a 2002 Volvo

[12:58]
with a "Reelect Al Gore" bumper sticker?

[13:00]
As relevant today as it was then.

[13:02]
Are you aware said Volvo is currently harboring a fugitive chicken,

[13:05]
along with a teenage girl, a small, sprite-like man,

[13:09]
and a maid of some sort?

[13:10]
That's my daughter! Not the maid. The other one.

[13:13]
I'd wager they're making a run for Gentle Farms.

[13:16]
Don't worry, though.

[13:17]
We'll bring your daughter home, dead or alive.

[13:20]
-Alive! Alive! -We're the L.A.P.D., ma'am.

[13:22]
-We'll probably make the right call. -Wait, wait, wait--

[13:25]
All right, troops, listen up!

[13:27]
I'm ready to go after these rabble-rousers with all--

[13:29]
Oh, no! Not until you get a warrant!

[13:32]
Ah, damn it, I hate due process!

[13:34]
You're a loose cannon, Meow Meow Fuzzyface.

[13:36]
No, I'm not. I'm a cannon, maybe, but a loose cannon?

[13:39]
Is that what you think of me?

[13:41]
I think you play by your own rules.

[13:42]
No way, he thinks rules were made to be broken.

[13:45]
These are all attributes of a loose cannon.

[13:47]
No, I'm just a reckless renegade.

[13:49]
-Sergeant Stone's a loose cannon. -Aah!

[13:51]
You shut your trap, Fuzzyface.

[13:54]
I'd say Stone's more of a cop on the edge with nothing to lose.

[13:57]
-That's a different thing. -Now I'm just confused.

[14:00]
Is Meow Meow Fuzzyface a loose cannon or not?

[14:03]
All right, put on a pot of coffee.

[14:05]
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.

[14:07]
[Stone groans]

[14:08]
Aw, man.

[14:10]
So full of burrito. Ooh.

[14:14]
Uh-oh, siesta time.

[14:16]
I need to go. Irving ran off with a fugitive chicken in my car.

[14:19]
We can take my car. This is perfect.

[14:21]
Why is this perfect? My daughter could be in danger.

[14:23]
Yes, I agree, but we can use the car ride to get some one-on-one.

[14:27]
I mean, who is BoJack?

[14:29]
I'm sure I can find another ride.

[14:30]
Every second you waste finding another ride,

[14:33]
your daughter gets closer to getting her eyes poked out by a mutant chicken,

[14:37]
or worse, death, or slightly better, teen pregnancy,

[14:39]
or worse again, salmonella.

[14:41]
Okay, fine. Let's go.

[14:43]
Yay! I'm calling this road trip the 007,

[14:45]
because we are gonna bond.

[14:46]
Up top? Down low? Either one? Both?

[14:50]
[Diane] Oh, wow, you guys have a movie night here?

[14:52]
-[Todd] Oh... -And we have 20 acres of pasture,

[14:55]
where our chickens have hours of free play.

[14:58]
See, Todd? She'll be happy here.

[15:00]
[Levi] She sure will.

[15:01]
[both] Because no one knows chicken like chickens.

[15:05]
Thank you for saving this poultry from a terrible life at a factory farm.

[15:09]
You're a hero.

[15:10]
But what if Chicken 4 Dayz tries to get her back?

[15:13]
Don't you worry about your friend.

[15:15]
-That chicken belongs to us now. -[Diane] Whoa!

[15:18]
-Where'd you get that gun? -You mean originally, or just now?

[15:21]
-Just now. -It was in that barrel.

[15:23]
-And what about originally? -Also that barrel.

[15:25]
Look, Becca, I know this is hard to understand,

[15:28]
but I have to go, and you can't come with me.

[15:30]
[clucks]

[15:31]
No, no, you don't need to book Beck anymore.

[15:34]
Now you can just be a chicken.

[15:37]
See, this is where you belong, okay?

[15:39]
You hear me? I don't want you no more.

[15:41]
You weren't the best friend I ever had,

[15:44]
and I never loved you! Now get, Becca!

[15:48]
I said get!

[15:50]
[sobbing]

[15:51]
[Becca clucking]

[15:54]
She really stretched out that dress.

[15:57]
She was so horrified, she checked into rehab.

[16:00]
So, I'm kind of the reason Drew Barrymore got sober.

[16:02]
Did you like Never Been Kissed? If so, you're welcome.

[16:05]
Can we have one conversation that isn't about you?

[16:07]
I don't understand why you need me to like you.

[16:10]
I don't need you to like me. It would be fun if you liked me,

[16:13]
because I'd prove my parents were wrong to never support me,

[16:16]
because I earned the admiration of an authority figure,

[16:18]
proving I have intrinsic worth,

[16:20]
but it's not a big deal or anything. Jeez.

[16:22]
Great story. You should put that in a podcast, so I can unsubscribe.

[16:25]
Can this piece of junk go any faster?

[16:27]
It's been screwy since I hit that deer a couple weeks back.

[16:30]
Probably should get it checked out.

[16:31]
[tire blows]

[16:32]
[both yelling]

[16:35]
[sighs]

[16:37]
Probably should've gotten it checked out.

[16:43]
-Those farmers seem nice. -Yeah.

[16:46]
I think Becca will be really happy there.

[16:48]
She'll have a nice life.

[16:50]
Yeah, until they kill her.

[16:53]
Well, yeah, but of all the places that will eventually kill her,

[16:56]
Gentle Farms seems like the best.

[16:59]
This doesn't feel right.

[17:00]
Becca was our friend.

[17:02]
-No. We gotta get her back. -Uh, what do you mean?

[17:05]
Remember when that guy cocked his gun and said:

[17:07]
"That chicken belongs to us now"?

[17:09]
He wasn't doing that because he likes cocking guns.

[17:12]
-Then we'll just bust her out. -Todd, there's nothing we can do.

[17:15]
Where else would Becca go?

[17:17]
She doesn't even speak English.

[17:18]
Well, we gotta do something.

[17:20]
Look, I know I'm a screw-up and all my ideas are terrible,

[17:23]
but with Becca, I was responsible for something.

[17:27]
I had a purpose.

[17:29]
Ah. I guess you wouldn't understand.

[17:33]
[groans]

[17:35]
-[tires screeching] -[Irving and Todd yell]

[17:37]
-Oh, my God, Diane! -All right. Let's bust her out.

[17:40]
Yes! Okay, and afterwards, will you get me an iPad?

[17:43]
-What? No. -But I really want an iPad.

[17:46]
Maybe you wouldn't understand.

[17:49]
Don't push it.

[17:52]
All right, all right, we've agreed. He's a loose cannon, but he gets results.

[17:56]
-I can live with that. -Now, you go bust those perps.

[17:59]
You'll need a maverick, a by-the-book rookie,

[18:01]
and a curmudgeonly veteran one week from retirement.

[18:04]
Go, go, go!

[18:05]
[men speaking indistinctly]

[18:06]
[news theme music plays]

[18:07]
We have received word that authorities are now en route to Gentle Farms

[18:11]
in an attempt to preempt the pursued poultry at the pass.

[18:15]
Do we have a graphic for this? No? Where's the graphic?

[18:17]
No, I'm not gonna go on until we have a graphic.

[18:20]
So, make one. I'll wait. Yeah, hold on, America,

[18:23]
Randy's gotta figure out how to do his job.

[18:25]
Because if I don't have a graphic, Randy,

[18:28]
people who are just tuning in--

[18:30]
Why am I explaining this to you? This is basic journalistic--

[18:33]
I swear to God! We'll be right back!

[18:38]
Just got to place the jack in the right jack apparatus.

[18:42]
There, I have got--

[18:44]
No. I have no idea what I'm doing.

[18:46]
That was me acting. Pretty convincing performance, huh?

[18:48]
There's more to me--

[18:50]
Are you capable of experiencing a moment

[18:52]
that you don't then make about you?

[18:53]
What was your plan to get out of here?

[18:55]
I don't know. Some hick will come by,

[18:57]
and I'll give him an autograph for a tow.

[18:59]
Boom, his life's changed, and you and I are on our way.

[19:02]
Oh, my God. I'm going to lose custody of my daughter.

[19:05]
The only reason I took this movie is for her.

[19:07]
This is my one shot at a big studio movie.

[19:10]
If I blow it, I'm back to making small, critically acclaimed movies

[19:13]
about lesbians learning how to recycle.

[19:15]
You think I want to be an indie darling?

[19:17]
Who's gonna fund Irving's education?

[19:19]
-Marla? With her seasonal nut butters? -Yeah, Marla sucks, right?

[19:23]
Indie-darling daughters don't go to Brown, okay?

[19:25]
They end up at cute pat-on-the-back factories like Vassar,

[19:28]
then move back in with their indie-darling mothers

[19:31]
and make puppet shows with their tampons,

[19:33]
and they get a profile in New York Magazine,

[19:35]
and the cycle continues.

[19:36]
Oh, my God, I'm a terrible mother.

[19:39]
Hey, I know terrible mothers,

[19:41]
and you're not a terrible mother.

[19:44]
Hey, aren't you the horse from Horsin' Around?

[19:47]
And you're the director

[19:48]
of Women Who Love Women Who Love Recycling.

[19:51]
Give you a lift in exchange for a couple autographs.

[19:54]
There he is. Right on time.

[20:01]
Shh, shh, shh.

[20:02]
Everyone keep quiet. We gotta--

[20:05]
Ooh. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

[20:07]
[grunting]

[20:10]
[wind chimes tinkling]

[20:11]
[gong sounds]

[20:13]
They probably didn't hear that.

[20:16]
Uh, that's probably a coincidence.

[20:18]
[Levi] Someone broke onto the farm!

[20:20]
Maybe they're rehearsing a one-act play

[20:22]
called Someone Broke Onto the Farm

[20:24]
and someone just said the titular line?

[20:26]
[door opens]

[20:27]
[gasps] This way.

[20:28]
-Oh. -Irving, this isn't safe.

[20:30]
Get in the car, lock the doors.

[20:31]
Don't be a badass and argue with me--

[20:33]
-Yeah, okay, bye! -Okay.

[20:35]
Go, go, go! [panting]

[20:38]
Uh...

[20:39]
[clucking]

[20:42]
Becca?

[20:44]
Who's making that ruckus in my chicken coop?

[20:47]
[all clucking loudly]

[20:49]
-Becca, where are you? -Becca, are you...?

[20:51]
Becca?

[20:53]
Is this you?

[20:54]
-[clucks] -Becca?

[20:57]
To-- To-- Todd?

[21:00]
Oh, I found her! Diane! This one's Becca!

[21:03]
No! Todd! Don't you get it?

[21:05]
-They're all Becca. -Oh.

[21:09]
Okay, go, chickens! You're free.

[21:10]
Go, run to freedom!

[21:12]
For generations they will tell your story!

[21:14]
-[Levi] Who goes there? -Oh, oh, oh, shit!

[21:17]
-We gotta hide! -Go, go, go!

[21:18]
[Todd panting]

[21:19]
Hide, hide! In here! Someplace safe.

[21:21]
Come on, come on. Oh, no!

[21:23]
[clucking]

[21:28]
-Shh, shh. Becca, no, no, no! -Shh.

[21:31]
[Levi] Only we know how to care for these creatures, you hear?

[21:34]
Like I say: No one knows chicken like chickens.

[21:39]
-[cocks gun] -[laughs]

[21:40]
Oh.

[21:41]
-Diane, I'm sorry I got you into this. -[sighs] It's not your fault.

[21:45]
I don't know why I always get into these messes.

[21:47]
You know, sometimes I feel like my whole life

[21:50]
is just a series of loosely-related wacky misadventures.

[21:54]
I think that's just what being in your 20s is.

[21:58]
-Really? -Yeah.

[21:59]
I'm supposed to be the adult here, and I'm a total mess.

[22:02]
You kidding? You're the coolest person I know.

[22:05]
-Really? -Yeah. You always know what to do,

[22:07]
and you don't take shit from anyone.

[22:09]
Is that how you see me?

[22:10]
Of course. You're like Lara Croft.

[22:13]
In Diane's body.

[22:15]
-[Levi cocks gun] -[Todd whimpering]

[22:19]
-This is our chance. Let's go! -Come on!

[22:21]
[Diane] Go, go, go!

[22:22]
[all gasping]

[22:23]
Please. Take me with you.

[22:25]
I hate it here. I don't want to kill chickens.

[22:28]
I want to design video games that help kids learn math.

[22:31]
Oh...

[22:32]
Whoa!

[22:34]
I am so sorry.

[22:36]
Okay, that was crazy! Just go.

[22:39]
Let's get out of here!

[22:46]
We're free, we're free! Oh, shit.

[22:48]
[siren whoops]

[22:50]
[tires screech]

[22:52]
Well, well, looks like birds of a feather...

[22:55]
go to jail.

[22:56]
-[clucking] -Why was he wearing sunglasses

[22:59]
at night?

[23:02]
I hope you folks like community service.

[23:05]
-I do. -What? Oh.

[23:08]
Oh, my God, Irving, thank God you're safe.

[23:10]
Mom, I'm fine.

[23:11]
Stop embarrassing me in front of my cool friends.

[23:14]
What? Cool?

[23:16]
I mean, that's cool that you think I'm cool.

[23:19]
I don't care or anything, but, you know, it's cool.

[23:22]
Hey, this guy. What'd you get arrested for?

[23:24]
-Being too cute? -[chuckles]

[23:26]
I want to be in his cell.

[23:27]
-[chuckles] -Listen up, everybody.

[23:28]
I, famous celebrity BoJack Horseman, have an announcement.

[23:32]
I'm going to ask you to drop all charges

[23:34]
on account of me being a celebrity.

[23:36]
We gracefully accept the requisite slap on the wrist

[23:38]
and a brief, but ultimately pointless, trial

[23:41]
in the court of public opinion. Good day.

[23:43]
Well, you are famous, so you are all free to go.

[23:47]
[Stone yells]

[23:48]
-But what about Becca? -Took care of that, too.

[23:50]
Called in a favor with Drew Barrymore,

[23:52]
and she'll pay off Chicken 4 Dayz to adopt your friend.

[23:55]
Does she have a meadow that Becca can frolic around in?

[23:58]
You think Drew Barrymore doesn't have a frolicking meadow?

[24:01]
That is the dumbest thing I've heard.

[24:02]
I learned something today.

[24:04]
When you think something isn't about you,

[24:06]
you find a way to save the day and realize that it was,

[24:09]
all along, all about you.

[24:11]
[groans]

[24:13]
Plus, I got you all a burrito truck!

[24:15]
-Hooray! -Yay! I'm great!

[24:21]
So, after all that, the only thing that saved Becca

[24:24]
was that BoJack was friends with Drew Barrymore?

[24:26]
-Yep. -So, did anything we did matter?

[24:29]
-Nope. -I think it did.

[24:31]
I think we made a difference.

[24:33]
A small one, but a difference.

[24:35]
Yeah, I think we did, too.

[24:37]
I think we really changed things for the better.
