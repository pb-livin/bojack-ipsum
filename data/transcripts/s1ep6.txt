[00:10]
- Huh? - Oh, uh, it's a pet name.

[00:13]
- I don't have actual honey. - [sighs]

[00:15]
- [laughter] - Diane!

[00:17]
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter. Mwah.

[00:20]
BoJack Horseman!

[00:22]
- Put her there! - That's all right.

[00:24]
I'm gonna get that handshake.

[00:25]
No, you're not.

[00:27]
[laughs] Since when am I Honey?

[00:28]
Since now.

[00:30]
I made up the nickname while you were back east.

[00:32]
Yeah, really? You made up calling someone honey?

[00:34]
Uh, I do believe so. Yes.

[00:36]
Hey, why don't we give BoJack a ride?

[00:37]
That's okay. Todd's supposed to pick me up.

[00:39]
Where is he?

[00:40]
[indistinct chatter] [cell door buzzing]

[00:42]
First day, huh? [laughs]

[00:44]
Well, stick with me. You're gonna be just fi--

[00:46]
- [grunts] - [gasps]

[00:49]
[gasping]

[00:50]
Probably just forgot, the lazy bum.

[00:52]
Hey, I'll take the ride as long as it's not as bumpy

[00:54]
as that pilot's landing.

[00:56]
That was seriously very scary.

[00:58]
- Hey... - I'm just glad you were there,

[01:00]
because I really would have freaked out by myself.

[01:02]
Be stiller, my beating heart.

[01:04]
Stiller crazy after all these years.

[01:06]
- [laughter] - Did I miss something funny?

[01:07]
- I love funny somethings. - No, we were just laughing

[01:09]
about this Ben Stiller article from the plane.

[01:12]
- [laughter] - Ooh, he is the best.

[01:13]
- What did it say? - You wouldn't get it.

[01:15]
Either you read Hemisphere's Magazine, or you don't.

[01:18]
Hey, I might be crazy, because this is such a dumb question,

[01:21]
and I'm embarrassed to even ask,

[01:23]
but do I have anything to worry about with you and Diane?

[01:28]
What?

[01:29]
[laughs] What?

[01:32]
Get out of here.

[01:34]
I got to say, BoJack,

[01:36]
that is a relief.

[01:38]
Ho-ho! Whoo!

[01:41]
[funky electronic music]

[01:44]
♪ ♪

[02:34]
[panting]

[02:36]
Hey, do you guys want to grab dinner?

[02:38]
Or at least some road sodas,

[02:39]
so I don't have to go through the ordeal

[02:41]
of sobering up and then having to get drunk all over again?

[02:43]
Oh, I actually already made special plans

[02:45]
for just the two of us.

[02:46]
Oh, come on.

[02:48]
You're the one who's always saying

[02:49]
you want to hang out with BoJack more,

[02:51]
and how it's weird that BoJack never returns your calls,

[02:53]
and how I should hang up the phone

[02:55]
because maybe BoJack's trying to call you right now.

[02:56]
Uh, okay.

[02:58]
I guess we can make this work.

[03:01]
- [laughter] - Oh.

[03:03]
Oh, man. Remember that guy in 34-B?

[03:05]
Do I? Can't stop remembering him.

[03:08]
Uh, hey. Diane and I have memories, too.

[03:10]
This place reminds me of a cliffside meal we had

[03:13]
one romantic vacay to Cabo.

[03:15]
Boring. I wasn't there.

[03:17]
Can we keep this general interests?

[03:19]
Well, here's to a meal we're all here for.

[03:22]
Mmm.

[03:24]
Oh, oh. Ew.

[03:25]
There's something in my food.

[03:27]
Ah, crap. Someone get the manager.

[03:28]
No, no, no. Wait.

[03:30]
It's supposed to be in there. Welcome home, honey.

[03:32]
I got you a D pendant, because I am D-pendant on you.

[03:37]
- Thank you. - Yeah. Real-- Real cute.

[03:39]
- A D for dog. - It's for Diane.

[03:42]
This is the sweetest choking hazard anyone's ever given me.

[03:45]
- [moans] - Mwah.

[03:47]
Well, how about some champagne for the happy couple.

[03:49]
Waiter, get me a bottle of Dom

[03:51]
to keep with the trend of sweet D gifts.

[03:54]
You're too kind,

[03:55]
but everyone knows you go off menu for the good stuff.

[03:59]
Yes, get me your most expensive bottle from the back.

[04:01]
Perhaps a 1922-ish Heidsieck Diamant Bleu?

[04:05]
A toast on me to Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter.

[04:08]
I'd like a round of drinks for everyone.

[04:10]
Off the menu, of course.

[04:12]
- [all cheering] - BoJack, folks. What a sport.

[04:15]
And while we're all in giving moods,

[04:17]
I'd like to buy you all an Xbox, courtesy of me.

[04:21]
[all cheering]

[04:22]
Wow. You guys don't have to do this.

[04:24]
Look, I could happily go down this petty road

[04:26]
of raising and re-raising one another.

[04:28]
[man] Please do!

[04:29]
But I'd instead like to highlight the fact

[04:31]
that Mr. Peanutbutter's ripping off my toast

[04:33]
the same way he ripped off my entire career.

[04:36]
[man 2] Uh, we prefer gifts over observations.

[04:39]
Okay. Well, here's something I didn't rip off.

[04:41]
This brand new helicopter I just bought.

[04:43]
Whoo-whoo! Who wants a ride in the chopper?

[04:46]
- [applause and cheering] - Okay, guys. This has been fun,

[04:48]
and also an offensive display of extravagant wealth,

[04:51]
but maybe we should call it a night.

[04:52]
What's the rush?

[04:54]
Because I just bought the restaurant,

[04:55]
and we can stay as long as we want.

[04:57]
- [all cheering] - Hey, you. I own you now.

[04:58]
- Do a dance. - [scats]

[05:04]
Oops.

[05:06]
[laughs] Oh, no. Hey, sorry, bud.

[05:07]
- It's all yours. - Please, you first.

[05:09]
Apparently, we both like to be clean.

[05:12]
I love being clean. That's so coincidental.

[05:15]
- I'm Todd. - Klaus.

[05:17]
Look, I know you're new here,

[05:19]
but we have a lot in common: being white, into cleansing.

[05:23]
I think you'd enjoy hanging out with me and the gang.

[05:26]
When you say "the gang," do you mean a gang?

[05:29]
Check this out. If you want to lift weights,

[05:31]
we got great yard connections.

[05:33]
If you like toilet wine, we spent the past 20 years

[05:35]
perfecting pruno.

[05:37]
The Aryan nation is number one for a reason.

[05:39]
Never thought I'd say this,

[05:41]
but you put a pretty good spin on Nazis.

[05:43]
Hey, tell you what. Drop by our party tomorrow.

[05:45]
Shoot the shit with the guys, mostly about Jews,

[05:47]
and make up your own mind.

[05:49]
Until then, take my card.

[05:51]
Whoa. Uh, where were you keeping that card?

[05:54]
[both] Forty-five, forty-six,

[05:57]
forty-seven...

[05:59]
Guys, can we give this thing a rest?

[06:02]
Rest? Why rest? I'm not tired.

[06:04]
I'm twice as not tired.

[06:12]
Or D, sex and candy?

[06:16]
[vibrates and rings]

[06:17]
[Todd] BoJack!

[06:19]
Todd, where the hell have you been?

[06:21]
I had to carpool home from the airport

[06:22]
like a goddamn environmentalist.

[06:24]
I'm sorry, but I'm in jail, dude.

[06:26]
Well, you called the right person, because I need your help

[06:29]
and you're my phone-a-friend.

[06:30]
Marie Curie won Nobel prizes in which two sciences?

[06:33]
A, chemistry and physics.

[06:35]
- B, biology and physics-- - Oh, B! The answer's B!

[06:38]
- It's A! - Damn it, Todd!

[06:39]
This was life or death.

[06:41]
Same with me. The bail's set at 50 bucks.

[06:43]
I'll be here wai--

[06:46]
[groaning]

[06:50]
Yes! I am the champion of the games!

[06:53]
Did you see that, Diane?

[06:55]
Diane?

[06:57]
You win, old friend.

[06:58]
Now if you'll excuse me,

[07:00]
I'm going to take my girlfriend to bed.

[07:02]
[groans]

[07:04]
We're still out?

[07:05]
[groans]

[07:07]
Night, BoJack.

[07:08]
Good night, Diane.

[07:11]
Give me a bottle of something to help me forget my problems.

[07:14]
Ooh, maybe not that strong.

[07:16]
What is this, breakfast?

[07:17]
Yeah, that's about right.

[07:19]
[gulping]

[07:26]
Well, that worked effectively.

[07:28]
[newsman] It's a Holly-who-done-it

[07:30]
as police are scrambling to figure out

[07:32]
who stole the D from the famed Hollywood sign.

[07:35]
- Holly-what? - All of Tinseltown's

[07:37]
at DEFCON 5 until their diabolically displaced D

[07:40]
is demonstrably displayed once more.

[07:43]
Can we cool it with the alliteration?

[07:44]
Who wrote this copy? Randy, looking at you.

[07:47]
Weird.

[07:49]
Weirder.

[07:50]
[doorbell rings]

[07:52]
Why the hell would I steal a giant D?

[07:54]
Ding-dong! It's Diane.

[07:55]
D-- D-- Damn!

[07:58]
Meanwhile, local authorities

[08:00]
are already investigating several suspects.

[08:01]
David Duchovny, Dick Van Dyke, DMX,

[08:04]
and of course Dane Cook, who we all know is a thief.

[08:07]
Hey, D-voted memoirist.

[08:10]
I can't work on the book today. Too ill. Cough.

[08:13]
Are you ill, or hung-over?

[08:15]
Because instead of coughing you just said the word cough.

[08:17]
Plus you left me a long, drunken voicemail last night.

[08:19]
Ooh, was it bad?

[08:20]
It was mostly a lot of wheezing,

[08:21]
as if you were climbing something,

[08:23]
followed by the sounds of dismantling metal,

[08:25]
and then grunting like you were dragging something heavy

[08:26]
at least a few miles.

[08:28]
I didn't say anything incriminating, did I?

[08:30]
As incriminating as that question? No.

[08:32]
Good. Well, just as a general rule,

[08:33]
you probably shouldn't be listening

[08:34]
to any voicemails I leave after--

[08:36]
- What time do I start drinking? - Noon?

[08:38]
- Yup. See you later. - But we had an appointment.

[08:40]
What's that? An actor flaking on an obligation?

[08:42]
- Welcome to Hollywood. - I think you mean Hollywoo.

[08:44]
Did you see? Someone stole the D off the sign.

[08:46]
Cough, cough, cough, cough, cough.

[08:47]
Cough, cough, cough, cough, door slam.

[08:50]
- [phone rings] - What is it, BoJack?

[08:52]
You know, I'm tied up with all my Deans today.

[08:54]
Kane, Norris, Winters, and Koontz,

[08:56]
all being questioned by police.

[08:58]
It was me. I stole the D.

[09:00]
- What? - Now be a good agent

[09:01]
and make this not my problem.

[09:03]
How did you even--?

[09:04]
You know, your scandal-to-work ratio is, like, five to one.

[09:07]
Look, I need to get rid of this before Diane sees it.

[09:09]
Why do you care if Dia-- Oh, fish.

[09:11]
Are you in love with your biographer?

[09:13]
What?

[09:15]
[laughs] What?

[09:18]
Get out of here.

[09:20]
You stole the D for Diane. Unbelievable.

[09:23]
Yeah, I don't know. The D might be for David,

[09:25]
because apparently when I was drunk,

[09:26]
I printed out a bunch of pictures of David Boreanaz.

[09:29]
Yeah. You did that.

[09:32]
Look, I'll keep your little crush busy long enough

[09:33]
for you to get rid of the contraband,

[09:35]
but the next three weddings I'm invited to,

[09:36]
you're my date, dummy.

[09:38]
Since when to women your age get invited to weddings?

[09:40]
I have a lot of nieces and nephews!

[09:42]
[phone beeps off]

[09:43]
- [claps] - Well, you pulled it off,

[09:44]
you deviant.

[09:46]
Get it? D-viant?

[09:49]
- I got it. - Tell me,

[09:50]
how are you gonna complete your giant bracelet?

[09:52]
With the chain-link fence from Dodger's Stadium?

[09:54]
No. How'd you figure out it was me?

[09:57]
Oh, how did I figure it out? Well, I just followed the clues,

[09:59]
used deduction, puzzle-solving, a little bit of forensics,

[10:02]
and also, what did I do?

[10:04]
Oh, I listened to the voicemail you left me

[10:06]
saying you were stealing the D because of Diane

[10:09]
so I could, and I quote, "Suck your D."

[10:12]
Stop leaving voicemails!

[10:14]
Admit it! You like my girlfriend.

[10:17]
Oh, come on. I mean, am I attracted to her? Sure.

[10:20]
Do my days feel better when I'm around her? Yeah.

[10:22]
Does she get me in ways no woman ever has? Indubitably.

[10:25]
Do I fantasize about her? Yes, but only in two positions.

[10:27]
Look, am I the kind of guy who would try to steal

[10:29]
someone else's girlfriend?

[10:31]
Sure, of course, but do I like her?

[10:32]
The answer's no. You have nothing to worry about.

[10:35]
I'll cut you a deal.

[10:36]
I help you get rid of that D,

[10:38]
and you never talk to Diane again.

[10:41]
Well, I have to talk to her, because she's writing my book.

[10:44]
Okay, but just don't pursue her romantically?

[10:47]
- Deal. - Ha!

[10:49]
- I knew I'd get that handshake. - I regret this already.

[10:54]
Spread them wide, ladies. This is a random cavity search.

[10:59]
[both] Whoa! Buy a guy a drink first.

[11:01]
- [laughs] - Did we just say that...

[11:03]
- Oh! - ...at the same time?

[11:05]
Look, I saw you talking to Klaus in the shower.

[11:08]
Now, the Aryans are good guys, don't get me wrong.

[11:11]
But I don't know if you're gonna get

[11:13]
the right attention over there.

[11:14]
Uh, I'd hate to get lost in a shop that big.

[11:17]
Now we can't offer you the works,

[11:19]
but in the Latin Kings, you'll be a star.

[11:21]
We're number two, and that means we try harder.

[11:24]
Am I really being courted by two gangs?

[11:27]
Oh, I feel like the belle of the ball.

[11:31]
So, this is the shapeless biographer

[11:34]
I've heard so much about.

[11:36]
We've met several times.

[11:38]
Did you just call me here to insult me?

[11:40]
What is your secret, lady?

[11:42]
I mean, how do you get two grown men fighting over you

[11:44]
like a foul ball at a football game?

[11:46]
First of all, football doesn't have foul balls.

[11:48]
Ugh, sports.

[11:49]
Second of all, nobody's fighting over me.

[11:52]
Open your eyes.

[11:53]
BoJack's clearly in love with you.

[11:55]
Wha--?

[12:01]
Get out of here!

[12:03]
Get out of here? Why would I get out of here?

[12:04]
You get out of here. This is my office.

[12:09]
I get the army men are police,

[12:10]
but what's the mustard packet again?

[12:12]
Oh, that's just a mustard packet.

[12:14]
- It's left over from lunch. - Oh.

[12:15]
Well, can we move it off the table?

[12:17]
No. I still might want it later.

[12:18]
Good call.

[12:19]
So how do we get the D from here

[12:21]
all the way up to here?

[12:23]
What, with all these cops and mustards,

[12:25]
- it's gonna be a pickle. - Oh, no.

[12:26]
The pickle's a SWAT van, but I see your point.

[12:28]
Might be easier to just ditch the evidence. But how?

[12:32]
I-- I don't know.

[12:34]
You think these coffees would get the juices flowing.

[12:36]
Well, they do have Bailey's in them.

[12:37]
Is that why I feel drunk?

[12:39]
Because I've had, like, seven or eight coffees.

[12:41]
I mean, I admit, it's been bad for ideas,

[12:43]
but it's been great for camaraderie.

[12:45]
Couldn't agree more.

[12:46]
Ooh, hey. What time is it?

[12:48]
I probably need to move my helicopter.

[12:50]
It's in a two-hour zone.

[12:51]
You beautiful bastard, that's it!

[12:53]
We can pick up the D with your chopper, fly it out of here,

[12:56]
and then dump it out into the ocean.

[12:58]
Stupendous!

[12:59]
Take that, the ocean.

[13:01]
[phone vibrates and rings]

[13:03]
- What now, Todd? - Listen.

[13:05]
So, kind of landed myself in a two-dates-to-the-prom situation.

[13:08]
The dates being prison gangs and the prom being a jump-in,

[13:12]
so do you remember how you got out of the same jam

[13:14]
on Horsin' Around?

[13:15]
Ah, a classic conundrum.

[13:17]
Well, I recall one time on Mr. Peanutbutter's House--

[13:20]
I think he's talking to me, pal.

[13:22]
You know, the guy whose show

[13:23]
invented the two-dates-to-the-prom story.

[13:25]
You may have invented it, but I think our show perfected it.

[13:29]
The only thing you ever perfected

[13:30]
- was stealing my thunder. - Stealing your thunder, eh?

[13:32]
Now you're even stealing the words I'm saying.

[13:34]
You know, it's tough.

[13:35]
I agree with the Latin Kings on social issues,

[13:38]
but fiscally I'm more of an Aryan.

[13:40]
Well, juggling both never ends well.

[13:42]
Mr. Peanutbutter, anything to contribute?

[13:44]
He's just staring blankly now.

[13:46]
Stealing your thunder.

[13:49]
You could also just bail me out of here, as I said.

[13:52]
- It's only 50 bucks-- - Got to go, pal.

[13:53]
Hope it's a magical night.

[13:55]
All right, you ready for the plan?

[13:56]
Oh, yeah.

[13:58]
But we are gonna need a big distraction

[14:00]
to keep the eyes off the skies.

[14:03]
You leave that to me.

[14:04]
Whoa, wait. You had a lot to drink.

[14:06]
You better have a cup of coffee.

[14:12]
Who loves you, people?

[14:14]
Look this way, news media.

[14:16]
A celebrity is throwing away his hard-earned cash.

[14:19]
Everyone pay attention to me.

[14:21]
Oh, it's only one-dollar bills, folks.

[14:23]
Don't bother.

[14:25]
No, it's still free, spendable money.

[14:27]
This is a huge story.

[14:28]
Dollars are like the new penny.

[14:30]
Yeah. Cash is for poor people.

[14:32]
What is wrong with you bozos?

[14:34]
Just riot over the damn money already.

[14:37]
Well, nothing to see here, I guess.

Mr. Peanutbutter, take her home.

[15:32]
Doctors have confirmed

[15:34]
that Beyoncé will never perform again.

[15:37]
This just in. A break in the story of the Hollywoo heist.

[15:40]
We now go live to the house of Mr. Peanutbutter,

[15:43]
star of Mr. Peanutbutter's House.

[15:45]
Ah, jeez. What did that idiot do?

[15:48]
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,

[15:50]
I, and I alone, stole the D from the Hollywoo sign.

[15:54]
[all gasping]

[15:56]
Just tell us, why'd you do it?

[15:58]
Oh, I'll tell you why.

[15:59]
I did it all for my girlfriend, Diane.

[16:02]
[all] Aww.

[16:04]
Son of a bitch.

[16:06]
That literal son of a bitch.

[16:09]
If you're joining us, Mr. Peanutbutter has confessed

[16:12]
to stealing the D for his girlfriend Diane

[16:15]
in what many are calling the most romantic gesture

[16:17]
in the history of romance and gestures.

[16:20]
We now await the L.A.P.D.'s move.

[16:21]
The day they make love a crime is the day I turn in my badge.

[16:25]
- [all clapping] - [grunts]

[16:28]
And here's our lady of the hour now, Diane.

[16:30]
Diane! What do you think?

[16:33]
Wow, Mr. Peanutbutter, uh, it's kind of a lot.

[16:37]
I don't really like to be on camera.

[16:39]
And?

[16:41]
Do you love anything or anyone?

[16:44]
I got to go. We'll talk about it later.

[16:49]
♪ Ooh ♪

[16:53]
Oh, my Todd.

[16:56]
You look-- You look beautiful, holmes.

[16:59]
What? This old thing?

[17:01]
The guards made me wear it.

[17:03]
Yeah, well, it suits you.

[17:05]
You're an autumn, bro.

[17:06]
[both gulping]

[17:08]
Ahh.

[17:09]
It's good, right?

[17:11]
Oh.

[17:13]
Come meet my boy, Santiago.

[17:14]
Uh, you know, I'll-- I'll be right back.

[17:16]
I-- I left my cot unmade.

[17:17]
- [panting] - Ooh, watch it.

[17:19]
Oh, sorry I'm late.

[17:21]
Hope you didn't think I was pulling an Anne Frank on you.

[17:24]
[laughs] Good one.

[17:28]
Can you believe it?

[17:29]
I was double-crossed by the one man

[17:31]
I assumed was too stupid to even single-cross.

[17:34]
What? I have no idea what you're talking about.

[17:36]
I do have a life outside of you, you know.

[17:38]
Mr. Peanutbutter took my D and gave it to Diane.

[17:41]
Once again, he completely ripped me off.

[17:43]
Oh, right. That whole thing.

[17:45]
[sighs] Just a minute, Cate.

[17:47]
Look, you may have come up with a log line,

[17:49]
but he's the one who sold the pitch.

[17:50]
This is more on brand for him than it is for you.

[17:52]
- What do you mean? - Desecrated a major landmark

[17:54]
in a drunken stupor, that's a BoJack Horseman thing.

[17:56]
But stealing it for your girlfriend

[17:58]
as a grand display of affection?

[18:00]
That's Mr. Peanutbutter.

[18:02]
You're right. It's Mr. Peanutbutter all over.

[18:05]
It's the kind of bold, romantic gesture

[18:07]
they base movies on.

[18:08]
Actually, that's not a bad idea.

[18:10]
Lora? Check if anyone's bought the rights yet.

[18:13]
Can we keep this about me, please?

[18:14]
Even if he stole your stealing of the D,

[18:16]
what he made his was telling Diane how he felt

[18:19]
from his heart.

[18:20]
You could never say it to me,

[18:21]
and you still can't say it to her.

[18:23]
That's not true. I can express feelings.

[18:25]
Nothing on the outside. Nothing on the inside.

[18:29]
Look, I got to bounce. Quick question, though.

[18:31]
Would you see Cate Blanchett in a movie about Eva Braun?

[18:34]
Why are you wasting my time with this?

[18:35]
- Of course I would. Who wouldn't? - Huh.

[18:39]
[disco music plays]

[18:40]
And that's why Eva Braun

[18:42]
was like the fifth Beatle of the Third Reich.

[18:45]
Wow. I never knew neo-Nazis were so interested in Nazis.

[18:51]
You got some great moves, Todd.

[18:53]
You dance like a white man, and I love it.

[18:56]
Hey, no disrespect,

[18:58]
but I got a few chess pieces I forgot need whittling.

[19:02]
[panting] Oh, excuse me.

[19:03]
Oh, thank God you're back.

[19:05]
I was getting nervous that you left me for another gang.

[19:08]
[laughs]

[19:10]
If that happened, I'd have to kill you.

[19:13]
[laughter]

[19:14]
[bleats]

[19:19]
Thank you for rescheduling

[19:20]
given your recent, uh, everything.

[19:23]
Yeah. That was really something.

[19:25]
I guess he makes your heart stand Stiller?

[19:28]
Yeah, but for some reason the jury's Stiller out

[19:31]
on how I feel about it.

[19:33]
Well, that's because it wasn't for you.

[19:35]
That wasn't a Diane thing. It was a Mr. Peanutbutter thing.

[19:37]
Well, what would be a Diane thing?

[19:39]
A Diane thing would be something that shows

[19:42]
he really knows you,

[19:44]
like giving you an iPod loaded with all your favorite podcasts,

[19:47]
or a practical houseplant,

[19:49]
or surprising you with a bound album

[19:51]
of photos and emails he saved.

[19:52]
That's-- That's what the Diane I know would want.

[19:55]
What are you saying to me?

[19:56]
Just that you should be

[19:58]
with someone who knows you.

[19:59]
Yeah? Like who?

[20:02]
- I-- - [device beeps]

[20:03]
Whoa, were we-- Were we taping?

[20:05]
Um, okay.

[20:06]
Uh, you want to hear my Andy Dick story?

[20:08]
It's a doozie.

[20:11]
All we ask for is 10% of anything pilfered.

[20:15]
Drugs, cigarettes.

[20:17]
I mean, that's the standard gang rate.

[20:18]
Hey, I got to go, uh, do a prison thing.

[20:24]
That sounds legitimate. We are in prison, after all.

[20:27]
[panting]

[20:29]
Whew. Hey.

[20:31]
White people, right?

[20:33]
Todd? Why in the name of Pat Buchanan

[20:36]
are you dressed like a Latin King?

[20:38]
- Uh, what-- - What the hell, bro?

[20:40]
- Are you playing both sides? - Look, guys,

[20:42]
I didn't want to choose between you because I like you both.

[20:45]
Look, in fact, if you just took the time

[20:48]
to get to know each other the way you did me,

[20:50]
I think you'd agree we don't need gangs anymore

[20:53]
because, deep down, we're all just people.

[20:58]
What do you say?

[21:00]
This just in. A standoff at the Super Max

[21:02]
has turned into a full-on race war.

[21:05]
But first, America has fallen in love with Hollywoo it-couple,

[21:09]
Mr. Peanutbutter and Diane--

[21:11]
[sighs]

[21:13]
[cell phone vibrating]

[21:15]
Diane? Is that you?

[21:20]
Hey. It's, um, me.

[21:23]
[nervously laughs]

[21:24]
Look, uh, things got a bit weird earlier,

[21:26]
so I-- I want to make sure that we're still on for tomorrow

[21:29]
to talk about the time I sneezed on Marisa Tomei.

[21:32]
I'm really sorry about before.

[21:33]
I know the D was overkill,

[21:35]
so I got you something more personal.

[21:38]
Aww.

[21:39]
I also wanted to just, um, let you know

[21:42]
how much I appreciate you working on this book with me.

[21:46]
I know I sometimes get carried away,

[21:50]
but it's because I love you so much.

[21:51]
You're a catch, Diane,

[21:53]
and I think you know how much I love catch.

[21:56]
And I'm sorry if I've been difficult in any way

[21:59]
during this process.

[22:00]
You know, it's-- It's really hard to have somebody,

[22:02]
I don't know, know you, I guess.

[22:05]
And you do, uh, know me, Diane.

[22:07]
We're very different, but I think we bring out

[22:10]
the best in each other.

[22:12]
It's like you're chocolate and I'm--

[22:13]
- Peanutbutter? - [laughs] What? Now see?

[22:15]
That was so much better than what I was gonna say.

[22:18]
- I was gonna say carrots. - [laughs]

[22:21]
And I know I'm not the perfect guy.

[22:22]
I actually kind of hate myself a lot of the time.

[22:26]
But when-- When I'm with you, I, uh, don't hate myself.

[22:30]
I like being around you,

[22:32]
and I don't know if I ever told you that

[22:34]
in so many words, so I'm telling you.

[22:37]
Diane, I've got an important question to ask.

[22:40]
No cameras, no big spectacle.

[22:43]
Just me and you.

[22:45]
Call me back.

[22:47]
This was BoJack, by the way.

[22:49]
Horseman, obviously.

[22:50]
Will you do the honor...

[22:52]
[cell phone chimes]

[22:53]
...of becoming Mrs. Peanutbutter?

[22:56]
Wow. This is happening so fast.

[23:00]
Yes. I'll marry you.

[23:02]
But I'm keeping my last name.

[23:04]
You hear that? She said yes!

[23:07]
- Let's kick it! - [festive music plays]

[23:08]
Erica, did you hear she said yes?

[23:10]
Come on in here! All right!

[23:13]
[fireworks pop and crackle]

[23:15]
She's not gonna call. Get out the consolation scotch.

[23:18]
[vibrates]

[23:19]
It's her! Make that celebration scotch.

[23:21]
- What's the difference? - It's the same scotch!

[23:23]
Diane! Hey, you!

[23:24]
Hey.

[23:26]
So this is weird.

[23:28]
I'm engaged.

[23:31]
Oh, wow.

[23:33]
To Mr. Peanutbutter?

[23:35]
I saw you left me a voicemail--

[23:37]
Delete it. It's just a drunken recipe for Bundt cake.

[23:39]
Not important.

[23:40]
Okay. I got to go.

[23:42]
They're about to move the D back.

[23:44]
- See you tomorrow? - Absolutely.

[23:49]
Well, nobody knows me like you.

[23:55]
[pilot] Time to bring this baby home.

[23:57]
To think I went from flying missions over Kandahar

[24:00]
to this cushy crap.

[24:03]
I spoke too soon!

[24:05]
Black Hawk down! Black Hawk down!

[24:07]
See, you guys aren't so different.

[24:10]
- [grunting] - [helicopter approaching]

[24:12]
[crashing]

[24:16]
We're free! We're free!

[24:18]
- Yeah! - Freedom!

[24:19]
- I am free! - Freedom!

[24:21]
Oh, wow.

[24:23]
What a twist, huh?

[24:25]
