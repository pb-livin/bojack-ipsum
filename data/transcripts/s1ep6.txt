BOJACK: Hey, D-voted memoirist. I can't work on the book today. Too ill. Cough.

[08:13]
DIANE: Are you ill, or hung-over? Because instead of coughing you just said the word cough. Plus you left me a long, drunken voicemail last night.

[08:19]
BOJACK: Ooh, was it bad?

BOJACK: What? [laughs] What? Get out of here.

[09:20]
CAROLYN: You stole the D for Diane. Unbelievable.

[09:23]
BOJACK: Yeah, I don't know. The D might be for David, because apparently when I was drunk, I printed out a bunch of pictures of David Boreanaz.

[09:29]
CAROLYN: Yeah. You did that. Look, I'll keep your little crush busy long enough for you to get rid of the contraband, but the next three weddings I'm invited to, you're my date, dummy.

[09:54]
BOJACK: No. How'd you figure out it was me?

[09:57]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, how did I figure it out? Well, I just followed the clues, used deduction, puzzle-solving, a little bit of forensics, and also, what did I do? Oh, I listened to the voicemail you left me saying you were stealing the D because of Diane so I could, and I quote, "Suck your D."

[10:12]
BOJACK: Stop leaving voicemails!

[10:14]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Admit it! You like my girlfriend.

[10:17]
BOJACK: Oh, come on. I mean, am I attracted to her? Sure. Do my days feel better when I'm around her? Yeah. Does she get me in ways no woman ever has? Indubitably. Do I fantasize about her? Yes, but only in two positions. Look, am I the kind of guy who would try to steal someone else's girlfriend? Sure, of course, but do I like her? The answer's no. You have nothing to worry about.

[10:35]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I'll cut you a deal. I help you get rid of that D, and you never talk to Diane again.

[12:17]
BOJACK: No. I still might want it later.

[12:18]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Good call. So how do we get the D from here all the way up to here? What, with all these cops and mustards, it's gonna be a pickle.

[12:25]
BOJACK: Oh, no. The pickle's a SWAT van, but I see your point. Might be easier to just ditch the evidence. But how?

[12:32]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I-- I don't know. You think these coffees would get the juices flowing.

[12:36]
BOJACK: Well, they do have Bailey's in them.

[12:37]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Is that why I feel drunk? Because I've had, like, seven or eight coffees.

[12:41]
BOJACK: I mean, I admit, it's been bad for ideas, but it's been great for camaraderie.

[12:45]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Couldn't agree more. Ooh, hey. What time is it? I probably need to move my helicopter. It's in a two-hour zone.

[12:51]
BOJACK: You beautiful bastard, that's it! We can pick up the D with your chopper, fly it out of here, and then dump it out into the ocean.

[13:15]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Ah, a classic conundrum. Well, I recall one time on Mr. Peanutbutter's House--

BOJACK: I think he's talking to me, pal. You know, the guy whose show invented the two-dates-to-the-prom story.

[13:25]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You may have invented it, but I think our show perfected it.

[13:29]
BOJACK: The only thing you ever perfected was stealing my thunder.

[13:31]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Stealing your thunder, eh?

[13:32]
BOJACK: Now you're even stealing the words I'm saying.

CAROLYN: Actually, that's not a bad idea. Laura? Check if anyone's bought the rights yet.

[18:13]
BOJACK: Can we keep this about me, please?

[18:14]
CAROLYN: Even if he stole your stealing of the D, what he made his was telling Diane how he felt from his heart. You could never say it to me, and you still can't say it to her.

[18:23]
BOJACK: That's not true. I can express feelings.

[18:25]
[flashback]

[18:26]
Nothing on the outside. Nothing on the inside.

[18:29]
CAROLYN: Look, I got to bounce. Quick question, though. Would you see Cate Blanchett in a movie about Eva Braun?

[18:34]
BOJACK: Why are you wasting my time with this? Of course I would. Who wouldn't?

[18:37]
CATE: Huh.

[18:39]
[disco music plays]

[18:40]
KLAUS: And that's why Eva Braun was like the fifth Beatle of the Third Reich.

[18:45]
TODD: Wow. I never knew neo-Nazis were so interested in Nazis.

[18:51]
KLAUS: You got some great moves, Todd. You dance like a white man, and I love it.

[18:56]
TODD: Hey, no disrespect, but I got a few chess pieces I forgot need whittling. [panting] Oh, excuse me.

[19:03]
LATIN KINGS GANG LEADER: Oh, thank God you're back. I was getting nervous that you left me for another gang. [laughs] If that happened, I'd have to kill you. [laughter] [bleats]

[19:19]
BOJACK: Thank you for rescheduling given your recent, uh, everything.

[19:23]
DIANE: Yeah. That was really something.

[19:25]
BOJACK: I guess he makes your heart stand Stiller?

[19:28]
DIANE: Yeah, but for some reason the jury's Stiller out on how I feel about it.

[19:33]
BOJACK: Well, that's because it wasn't for you. That wasn't a Diane thing. It was a Mr. Peanutbutter thing.

[19:37]
DIANE: Well, what would be a Diane thing?

[19:39]
BOJACK: A Diane thing would be something that shows he really knows you, like giving you an iPod loaded with all your favorite podcasts, or a practical houseplant, or surprising you with a bound album of photos and emails he saved. That's-- That's what the Diane I know would want.

[19:55]
DIANE: What are you saying to me?

[19:56]
BOJACK: Just that you should be with someone who knows you.

[19:59]
DIANE: Yeah? Like who?

[20:02]
BOJACK: I--

[20:03]
[device beeps]

[20:04]
BOJACK: Whoa, were we-- Were we taping? Um, okay. Uh, you want to hear my Andy Dick story? It's a doozie.

[20:11]
LATIN KINGS GANG LEADER: All we ask for is 10% of anything pilfered. Drugs, cigarettes. I mean, that's the standard gang rate.

[20:18]
TODD: Hey, I got to go, uh, do a prison thing.

[20:24]
LATIN KINGS GANG LEADER: That sounds legitimate. We are in prison, after all.

[20:27]
TODD: [panting] Whew. Hey. White people, right?

[20:33]
KLAUS: Todd? Why in the name of Pat Buchanan are you dressed like a Latin King?

[20:38]
TODD: Uh, what--

[20:39]
LATIN KINGS GANG LEADER: What the hell, bro?

[20:40]
KLAUS: Are you playing both sides?

[20:42]
TODD: Look, guys, I didn't want to choose between you because I like you both. Look, in fact, if you just took the time to get to know each other the way you did me, I think you'd agree we don't need gangs anymore because, deep down, we're all just people. What do you say?

[21:00]
TOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: This just in. A standoff at the Super Max has turned into a full-on race war. But first, America has fallen in love with Hollywoo it-couple, Mr. Peanutbutter and Diane--

[21:11]
BOJACK: [sighs]

[21:13]
[cell phone vibrating]

[21:15]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Diane? Is that you?

[21:20]
BOJACK: Hey. It's, um, me. [nervously laughs] Look, uh, things got a bit weird earlier, so I-- I want to make sure that we're still on for tomorrow to talk about the time I sneezed on Marisa Tomei.

[21:32]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I'm really sorry about before. I know the D was overkill, so I got you something more personal.

[21:38]
DIANE: Aww.

[21:39]
BOJACK: I also wanted to just, um, let you know how much I appreciate you working on this book with me.

[21:46]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I know I sometimes get carried away, but it's because I love you so much. You're a catch, Diane, and I think you know how much I love catch.

[21:56]
BOJACK: And I'm sorry if I've been difficult in any way during this process. You know, it's-- It's really hard to have somebody, I don't know, know you, I guess. And you do, uh, know me, Diane.

[22:07]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: We're very different, but I think we bring out the best in each other. It's like you're chocolate and I'm--

[22:13]
DIANE: Peanutbutter?

[22:14]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: [laughs] What? Now see? That was so much better than what I was gonna say. I was gonna say carrots.

[22:19]
DIANE: [laughs]

[22:21]
BOJACK: And I know I'm not the perfect guy. I actually kind of hate myself a lot of the time. But when-- When I'm with you, I, uh, don't hate myself. I like being around you, and I don't know if I ever told you that in so many words, so I'm telling you.

[22:37]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Diane, I've got an important question to ask. No cameras, no big spectacle. Just me and you.

[22:45]
BOJACK: Call me back. This was BoJack, by the way. Horseman, obviously.

[22:50]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Will you do me the honor...

[22:52]
[cell phone chimes]

[22:53]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: ...of becoming Mrs. Peanutbutter?

[22:56]
DIANE: Wow. This is happening so fast. Yes. I'll marry you. But I'm keeping my last name.

[23:04]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You hear that? She said yes! Let's kick it!

[23:07]
[festive music plays]

[23:08]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Erica, did you hear she said yes? Come on in here! All right!

[23:13]
[fireworks pop and crackle]

[23:15]
BOJACK: She's not gonna call. Get out the consolation scotch.

[23:18]
[vibrates]

[23:19]
BOJACK: It's her! Make that celebration scotch.

[23:21]
ELEPHANT BARTENDER: What's the difference?

[23:22]
BOJACK: It's the same scotch! Diane! Hey, you!

[23:24]
DIANE: Hey. So this is weird. I'm engaged.

[23:31]
BOJACK: Oh, wow. To Mr. Peanutbutter?

[23:35]
DIANE: I saw you left me a voicemail--

[23:37]
BOJACK: Delete it. It's just a drunken recipe for Bundt cake. Not important.

[23:40]
DIANE: Okay. I got to go. They're about to move the D back. See you tomorrow?

[23:47]
BOJACK: Absolutely. Well, nobody knows me like you.

[23:55]
PILOT: Time to bring this baby home. To think I went from flying missions over Kandahar to this cushy crap. I spoke too soon! Black Hawk down! Black Hawk down!

[24:07]
TODD: See, you guys aren't so different.

[24:10]
LATIN KINGS GANG LEADER: [grunting]

[24:11]
[helicopter approaching] [crashing]

[24:16]
INMATES: We're free! We're free! Yeah! Freedom! I am free! Freedom!

[24:21]
TODD: Oh, wow. What a twist, huh? And they say there's no new stories in Hollywoo. [sighs]
