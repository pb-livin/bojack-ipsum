BOJACK: The most important thing is, you got to give the people what they want, even if it kills you, even if it empties you out until there's nothing left to empty. No matter what happens, no matter how much it hurts, you don't stop dancing, and you don't stop smiling, and you give those people what they want.

[18:42]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, I just have a guy there who calls me whenever TV awards come in so I can buy 'em. I put my name on, it's like I won it myself! I have two Golden Globes and a People's Choice for Temple Grandin.

[18:52]
BOJACK: Sarah Lynn!

[18:53]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hello? You still there?

[18:56]

[18:58]
BOJACK: Okay, party's over. Everybody out.

[19:00]
CROWD: Aw!

[19:01]
BOJACK: Not you. You are in big trouble, young lady.

[19:04]
BOJACK: I can't believe you pawned my award.

[19:06]
SARAH LYNN: It wasn't personal. I just thought your award was stupid, and I already have a billion other awards, and I wanted to get money for drugs.

[19:13]
BOJACK: Look, things have been tough for you, and I understand that. I know what you're going through right now.

[19:18]
SARAH LYNN: [chuckling] Oh, you know what I'm going through? Why? Because you were on some dumb kids show a million years ago?

[19:24]
BOJACK: Hey, now.

[19:25]
SARAH LYNN: I had my own fashion line when I was ten. By 20, I was packing stadiums. I get letters every day from boys telling me that I was the first girl they masturbated to. Literally, someone tells me that every day.

[19:38]
BOJACK: That is gross.

[19:39]
SARAH LYNN: Oh-ho, I know! You sit up here in your little house and feel sorry for yourself? Oh, guess what, Bo-j, in order to be a has-been, you have to have actually, you know, been.

[19:49]
BOJACK: You are way out of line!

[19:51]
SARAH LYNN: You're not my dad. You're just a rugged, older man who provided me with a strong, masculine presence during my formative years.

[19:57]
BOJACK: I'm not your dad, and you're not my child. We're just a man and a lady living in a house together, and we're both adults, and we're both a little drunk.

[20:05]
[both groaning]

[20:09]
BOJACK: Who-o-o lit my ottoman on fire?

[20:13]
TODD: Seriously, you seriously don't know?

[20:16]
SARAH LYNN: I'm a bad "widdle" girl.

[20:19]
BOJACK: Yeah, you are bad, very bad!

[20:21]
SARAH LYNN: You want me to put it out with my boob?

[20:25]
TODD: Uh, what?

[20:26]
BOJACK: Your boob is a very impractical way to put out a fire.

[20:31]
TODD: What is happening?

[20:33]
BOJACK: I think you have a serious drug problem.

[20:35]
SARAH LYNN: The only drug I need is horse.

[20:38]
TODD: Guys, guys, what are you doing? Please don't do this.

[20:40]
[both moaning]

[20:41]
TODD: No, no. Why are you--

[20:43]
BOJACK: [whinnies]

[20:44]
TODD: This is a very bad idea. Can I at least get my blanket-- Let me get my blanket out from under-- Oh G-- Oh, my God, my arm. You got my arm.


SARAH LYNN: [laughs] Ow! Ow!

[20:52]
TODD: I'm in it now. Oh, God, no! I'm a part of it.

[20:58]
TODD: I still haven't regained the feeling in my fingers. That was the longest two minutes of my life.

[21:03]
BOJACK: Um, I think it was a little longer than two minutes. It was longer than two minutes.

[21:07]
TODD: How do you not get that this is terrible?

[21:10]
BOJACK: Oh, you mean from a P.R. standpoint? Yeah, 'cause if this got out, oh, I would get flayed!

[21:15]
TODD: Oh, I'm done being the voice of reason. It's exhausting. I got to take an angry nap. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.

[21:24]
BOJACK: I know. I know. She's taking advantage of me.

[21:27]
DIANE: Actually, it kind of feels like you're the one taking advantage of her. She's the one with substance abuse problems and daddy issues.

[21:33]
BOJACK: Hey, we both have substance abuse problems and daddy issues.

[21:36]
DIANE: Yeah, but she came to you for help.

[21:38]
BOJACK: [sighs]

[21:41]
CAROLYN: Hey, notice how I've been ignoring you, playing hard to get? Only makes you want me more.

[21:45]
SARAH LYNN: Ugh. Go stand on the other side of the room.

[21:47]
CAROLYN: Okay.

[21:48]
BOJACK: Sarah Lynn, get your coat. I'm taking you to rehab.

[21:50]
SARAH LYNN: Nah, I was gonna keep hanging out here if that's all right.

[21:54]
BOJACK: No, it's not all right.

[21:55]
SARAH LYNN: What?

[21:56]
BOJACK: This place isn't good for you. You need to go where you can get help, real help.

[22:00]
SARAH LYNN: But I thought you were always gonna be there for me like you said.

[22:03]
[flashback]

[22:04]
BOJACK [ON TV]: I will always be there for you.

[22:07]
DIRECTOR: Cut, let's take ten. That's ten, everyone. Let's make it a tight ten.

[22:10]
BOJACK: These pages are shit.

[22:11]
SARAH LYNN: [coughs]

[22:12]
BOJACK: You understand? Shit. I wouldn't wipe my ass with these pages. It would defeat the whole purpose of wiping my ass.

[22:18]
LOBSTER: Phone for you.

[22:19]
BOJACK: Uh-huh. You get me points on the back end?

[22:21]
SARAH LYNN: [coughs]

[22:22]
BOJACK: Well, I told you I'm not gonna do it unless I get points. Oh, they can't find any? Well, maybe they could suck some out of my dick!

[22:27]
SARAH LYNN: [coughs]

[22:28]
BOJACK: I'm on the phone. You're being very rude.

[22:30]
SARAH LYNN: [laughs]

[22:31]
SARAH LYNN: You promised me you would always be there.

[22:33]
BOJACK: Sarah Lynn, this is for your own good. You can't stay here anymore.

[22:37]
SARAH LYNN: Okie-doke. I guess I'll just move out and find one of the billion people who will let me party at their house.

[22:43]
BOJACK: Uh, well, you should not do that.

[22:45]
SARAH LYNN: Oh, I know. I know, but I can, so I will. I'm at a place right now where I never need to grow as a person or rise to an occasion because I can constantly just surround myself with sycophants and enablers until I die tragically young.

[22:58]
BOJACK: Wh-What?

[22:59]
SARAH LYNN: Yeah, it's pretty much too late for me. Well, them's the breaks. Take it sleazy, everybody. Oh, by the way, I called Vanessa Gecko, and I'm meeting with her tomorrow. Thanks for the suggestion.

[23:12]
CAROLYN: No! No, no, no, no, no!

[23:13]
SARAH LYNN: Hey, you guys want to hear my new catchphrase? Suck a dick, dumb shits! [blows raspberry]

[23:20]
CAROLYN: [grunting] Laura, the dummy took the bait. Now for phase two.

[23:25]
TODD: Is she gone? Is it safe to come out?

[23:29]
CAROLYN: Leak to the trades that Andrew Garfield's agent is taking meetings with his ex, get it all over town, wait an hour, then get me lunch with Andrew on the books for this weekend, someplace Italian.

[23:40]
BOJACK: I really blew it, didn't I?

[23:41]
DIANE: I mean, maybe you could have been a better role model when she was young, but also, she never really had a chance. This is what our celebrity culture does to people.

[23:49]
BOJACK: So what you're saying is, Everything is society's fault, and we as individuals never need to take responsibility for anything?

[23:56]
DIANE: Uh, no. Not exactly. I was just saying that--

[23:59]
BOJACK: Yeah. I like that. I didn't do anything wrong because I can't do anything wrong because we're all just products of our environment, bouncing around like marbles in the game of Hungry Hungry Hippos that is our random and cruel universe.

[24:09]
DIANE: Wait, no, that's not even what I'm saying--

[24:11]
BOJACK: Yeah, It's not my fault. It's society. Everything is because of society!

[24:16]
DIANE: BoJack, that--

[24:17]
TODD: Dude, just let him have this.

[24:19]
BOJACK: Hooray! Everything is meaningless! Nothing I do has consequence!

[24:26]
BLUEJAY: So what'd you get, anything good?

[24:28]
ROBIN: Oh, I got everything.
