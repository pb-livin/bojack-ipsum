if it's even possible for women to reclaim their sexuality

[15:19]
Todd, how many times have we been over this?

[15:21]
You don't have the authority to call house meetings.

[15:23]
Only I can call a house meeting. You can propose a house meeting.

[15:27]
All right, fine, fine, fine, but the reason I propose

[15:29]
- this house meeting-- - Your proposal has been

[15:31]
submitted and is under board review.

[15:33]
- Proposal denied. - BoJack, this Sarah Lynn thing

[15:35]
is getting out of control, okay? She's taking advantage of you.

[15:39]
What? No she's not. We have a special relationship.

[15:41]
You couldn't possibly understand.

[15:43]
Oh, my God. Look at what she's done to your house.

[15:45]
All right, look, I mean, I stepped on a needle earlier.

[15:48]
I think I'm addicted to heroin now,

[15:49]
so now, that's probably gonna be a whole thing.

[15:52]
I have to say, I agree with Todd.

[15:54]
You're not this girl's father, and you're not doing her

[15:55]
any favors by refusing to set boundaries.

[15:57]
Look, I played a dad for nine years on TV,

[16:00]
so I think I know a little bit more about parenting

[16:02]
than you two jokers. The kids on Horsin' Around

[16:04]
didn't need boundaries.

[16:06]
All they needed was some good, old-fashioned love.

[16:11]
This is real life.

Ah! Lemur on fire! Lemur on fire!

[16:36]
Ugh. Too much nutmeg.

[16:38]
Well, you know what would taste even better?

[16:40]
An endorsement for a Slovakian yogurt.

[16:42]
Could Vanessa Gecko get you that?

[16:45]
Vanessa Gecko got Andrew The Social Network,

[16:49]
and she has skybox seats at the Staples Center.

[16:51]
- What do you have? - Well, I've got a table

[16:53]

[16:54]
Hey, Sarah Lynn, what say we spend the day together,

[16:57]
just you and me, away from all the haters?

[16:59]

Hey, did you hear Kazaz got cancer?

[17:28]
What? Herb Kazaz has cancer?

[17:30]
Yeah, in the butt. He's got, like, six months I think.

[17:33]
Well, that's horrible. Why would you tell me that now?

[17:35]
I don't know. The sun setting over those two hills

[17:38]
made me think of a big ass, and that made me think

[17:40]
of ass cancer, and that made me think

[17:41]
of Herb Kazaz's ass cancer. You really didn't know?

[17:45]
No, Herb and I aren't on the best--

[17:46]
Look, I'm trying to have a moment here. I can't--

[17:49]
Hey, I want to give you something.

[17:51]
Is this your TV Guide award?

[17:53]
It's the most prestigious award I ever won.

[17:56]
I always thought if I ever had kids of my own,

[17:57]
I'd give it to them one day. I want you to have it.

You are in big trouble, young lady.

[19:04]
I can't believe you pawned my award.

[19:06]
It wasn't personal. I just thought your award was stupid,

[19:09]
and I already have a billion other awards,

[19:11]
and I wanted to get money for drugs.

[19:13]
Look, things have been tough for you, and I understand that.

[19:16]
I know what you're going through right now.

[19:18]
[chuckling] Oh, you know what I'm going through? Why?

[19:21]
Because you were on some dumb kids show a million years ago?

[19:24]
- Hey, now. - I had my own fashion line

[19:26]
when I was ten. By 20, I was packing stadiums.

[19:29]
I get letters every day from boys telling me

[19:32]
that I was the first girl they masturbated to.

[19:35]
Literally, someone tells me that every day.

[19:38]
- That is gross. - Oh-ho, I know!

[19:41]
You sit up here in your little house

and feel sorry for yourself? Oh, guess what, Bo-j,

in order to be a has-been, you have to have actually,

[19:48]
- you know, been. - You are way out of line!

[19:51]
You're not my dad. You're just a rugged, older man

[19:53]
who provided me with a strong, masculine presence

[19:55]
during my formative years.

[19:57]
I'm not your dad, and you're not my child.

[19:59]
We're just a man and a lady living in a house together,

[20:02]

I'm a bad "widdle" girl.

[20:19]
Yeah, you are bad, very bad!

[20:21]
You want me to put it out with my boob?

[20:25]
- Uh, what? - Your boob

[20:27]
is a very impractical way to put out a fire.

[20:31]
What is happening?

[20:33]
I think you have a serious drug problem.

[20:35]
The only drug I need is horse.

[20:38]
Guys, guys, what are you doing?

Please don't do this. [both moaning]

No, no. Why are you-- [both moaning]

- [whinnies] - This is a very bad idea.

[20:45]
[both moaning] Can I at least get my blanket--

[20:47]
Let me get my blanket out from under--

[20:49]
Oh G-- Oh, my God, my arm.

[20:50]
- You got my arm. - [laughs] Ow! Ow!

[20:52]
I'm in it now. Oh, God, no! I'm a part of it.

[20:54]
[both moaning]

[20:58]
I still haven't regained the feeling in my fingers.

[21:01]
That was the longest two minutes of my life.

[21:03]
Um, I think it was a little longer than two minutes.

[21:06]
It was longer than two minutes.

[21:07]
How do you not get that this is terrible?

[21:10]
Oh, you mean from a P.R. standpoint?

[21:12]
Yeah, 'cause if this got out, oh, I would get flayed!

[21:15]
Oh, I'm done being the voice of reason.

[21:18]
It's exhausting. I got to take an angry nap.

[21:22]
Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.

[21:24]
I know. I know. She's taking advantage of me.

[21:27]
Actually, it kind of feels like you're the one

[21:29]
taking advantage of her. She's the one

[21:30]
with substance abuse problems and daddy issues.

[21:33]
Hey, we both have substance abuse problems

[21:35]
- and daddy issues. - Yeah, but she came to you

[21:37]
- for help. - [sighs]

[21:41]
Hey, notice how I've been ignoring you,

[21:43]
playing hard to get? Only makes you want me more.

[21:45]
Ugh. Go stand on the other side of the room.

[21:47]
- Okay. - Sarah Lynn, get your coat.

[21:49]
- I'm taking you to rehab. - Nah,

[21:51]
I was gonna keep hanging out here if that's all right.

[21:54]
- No, it's not all right. - What?

[21:56]
This place isn't good for you.

[21:58]
You need to go where you can get help, real help.

[22:00]
But I thought you were always gonna be there for me

[22:03]
like you said.

[22:04]
I will always be there for you.

[22:07]
Cut, let's take ten.

[22:08]
That's ten, everyone. Let's make it a tight ten.

[22:11]
- These pages are shit. - [coughs]

[22:12]
you understand? Shit.

[22:14]
I wouldn't wipe my ass with these pages.

[22:16]
It would defeat the whole purpose of wiping my ass.

[22:18]
- Phone for you. - Uh-huh.

[22:19]
You get me points on the back end?

[22:21]
- [coughs] - Well, I told you

[22:22]
I'm not gonna do it unless I get points.

[22:24]
Oh, they can't find any?

[22:25]
Well, maybe they could suck some out of my dick!

[22:27]
- [coughs] - I'm on the phone.

[22:28]
- You're being very rude. - [laughs]

[22:31]
You promised me you would always be there.

[22:33]
Sarah Lynn, this is for your own good.

[22:36]
You can't stay here anymore.

[22:37]
Okie-doke. I guess I'll just move out

[22:39]
and find one of the billion people

[22:41]
who will let me party at their house.

[22:43]
Uh, well, you should not do that.

[22:45]
Oh, I know. I know, but I can, so I will.

[22:48]
I'm at a place right now where I never need

[22:50]
to grow as a person or rise to an occasion

[22:53]
because I can constantly just surround myself

[22:56]
with sycophants and enablers until I die tragically young.

[22:58]
- Wh-What? - Yeah,

[23:00]
it's pretty much too late for me.

[23:03]
Well, them's the breaks. Take it sleazy, everybody.

[23:06]
Oh, by the way, I called Vanessa Gecko,

[23:09]
and I'm meeting with her tomorrow.

[23:11]
- Thanks for the suggestion. - No! No, no, no, no, no!

[23:13]
Hey, you guys want to hear my new catchphrase?

[23:16]
Suck a dick, dumb shits! [blows raspberry]

is taking meetings with his ex, get it all over town,

[23:34]
wait an hour, then get me lunch with Andrew

[23:36]
on the books for this weekend, someplace Italian.

[23:40]
I really blew it, didn't I?

[23:41]
I mean, maybe you could have been a better role model

[23:44]
when she was young, but also, she never really had a chance.

[23:47]
This is what our celebrity culture does to people.

[23:49]
So what you're saying is, Everything is society's fault,

[23:53]
and we as individuals never need

[23:54]
to take responsibility for anything?

[23:56]
Uh, no. Not exactly. I was just saying that--

[23:59]
Yeah. I like that. I didn't do anything wrong

[24:02]
because I can't do anything wrong

[24:03]
because we're all just products of our environment,

[24:05]
bouncing around like marbles

[24:06]
in the game of Hungry Hungry Hippos

[24:08]
that is our random and cruel universe.

[24:09]
Wait, no, that's not even what I'm saying--

[24:11]
Yeah, It's not my fault. It's society.

[24:14]
Everything is because of society!

[24:16]
- BoJack, that-- - Dude, just let him have this.

[24:19]
Hooray! Everything is meaningless!

[24:21]
Nothing I do has consequence!

[24:26]
So what'd you get, anything good?

[24:28]
Oh, I got everything.
