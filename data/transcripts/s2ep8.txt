[00:08]
-We're live in five minutes, folks. -[crew member] Make way.

[00:11]
Someone find out the average rainfall in Bora Bora.

[00:14]
Thank you so much for doing this.

[00:15]
Hey, there are a lot of advantages to being the girlfriend of a big celebrity.

[00:19]
It's more than being an elbow

[00:20]
they couldn't crop out of a red-carpet shot in US Weekly.

[00:23]
-I've been that elbow. -Hello, what have we here?

[00:26]
So you know how the game's played, right?

[00:28]
I'm sure I'll pick it up. How hard could it be?

[00:30]
You didn't read the treatment? I faxed it to you.

[00:32]
My bad, our fax machine isn't plugged in.

[00:34]
BoJack, this is our first show

[00:36]
and it is very important that things run smoothly tonight.

[00:39]
I mean, do you even care about this at all?

[00:41]
Sweetie, no. I think this is stupid and a waste of everybody's time.

[00:45]
But you're my girlfriend and I care about you.

[00:47]
-So I'm here. -Okay. Break a leg.

[00:50]
[vocalizing] Me, me, me. My, my, my. Bow-wow-wow-wow.

[00:53]
Good boy, good boy.

[00:56]
Okay, this is it, everybody. Moment of truth.

[00:58]
Now it's in the hands of god.

[01:00]
And for the next 30 minutes, I am that God.

[01:03]
-I got you an iPad, ma'am. -Oh, no thanks, Mia.

[01:06]
I'm still working my way through the last 30 years of technology.

[01:09]
Right now I'm on Palm Pilot.

[01:10]
But you can use our second screen app to see what viewers say

[01:13]
about the show as it airs.

[01:14]
Oh, cool, I love stupid bullshit like this. Ooh.

[01:18]
Oh, you just touch it.

[01:19]
Hello, I am Mustache Todd. Like regular Todd, but with a mustache.

[01:24]
Listen boo-boo, I didn't graduate first in my class from a prestigious university,

[01:28]
rise through the ranks at an elite news organization,

[01:31]
win a well-known award, never ever be sick at sea

[01:34]
and also my name is Mia McKibben, so that I could deal with your nonsense.

[01:38]
-[grunts] -Todd, stay out of Hair and Makeup.

[01:40]
But I like it there.

[01:41]
They brush my hair and tell me stories about their weekends.

[01:44]
Big-nosed Todd wasn't funny, Zombie Todd wasn't funny,

[01:47]
Pretty Lady Todd wasn't funny,

[01:49]
and this isn't funny. No more tomfoolery.

[01:51]
When it's me, we call it "Todd-foolery."

[01:54]
We certainly do not call it that.

[01:56]
Listen up, everyone.

[01:57]
What you are part of tonight is bigger than you.

[01:59]
It's bigger than any of us.

[02:01]
I expect all of you to work together.

[02:03]
But I also expect that one of you will tower above the rest.

[02:06]
And that outstanding individual will receive this pen.

[02:11]
It was through this pen that I bled

[02:14]
Raise High The Roof Beam, Carpenters upon the page.

[02:17]
Also, it has four different colors.

[02:19]
Black, red, blue and for some reason, green.

[02:22]
By the end of tonight,

[02:23]
this pen will be bestowed upon the person most deserving.

[02:27]
Because nothing is more important than television,

[02:30]
and no one more important than the people who make that television.

[02:34]
-Now, let's get to work. -[AD] And five, four,

[02:38]
-three, two... -[J.D.] Showtime.

[02:42]
[♪♪]

[03:35]
-[audience cheering] -[lively music playing over speakers]

[03:38]
[announcer] Live from the historic Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip,

[03:42]
J.D. Salinger Presents:

[03:43]
Hollywoo Stars And Celebrities, What Do They Know?

[03:46]
Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out!

[03:49]
[howls]

[03:51]
Ah. All right! Here we go.

[03:54]
Listen to that crowd.

[03:56]
If they lose it this much for Mr. Peanutbutter,

[03:58]
can you imagine what they're going to do for a real celebrity?

[04:01]
Hey, this is Mr. Peanutbutter's show, so be nice.

[04:04]
When you say nice, do you mean kind?

[04:06]
Or, like, delivering a lot of sick burns,

[04:08]
so that people in the audience go, "Nice."

[04:10]
The first one. Obviously the first one.

[04:13]
Tonight we answer the age-old question:

[04:16]
"Hollywoo stars and celebrities, what do they know?

[04:19]
Do they know things? Let's find out!"

[04:21]
-[audience cheering] -[music resumes]

[04:23]
And now our first-ever guest.

[04:25]
You know him from his years on Horsin' Around,

[04:28]
his drunk appearance on The View,

[04:29]
and his bestselling book, it's BoJack Horseman.

[04:34]
-[audience cheering] -[BoJack chuckles]

[04:36]
There you are. How are you doing?

[04:38]
-BoJack, welcome. -It is great to be here.

[04:40]
Sorry, no time for idle chit-chat, because we've entered

[04:43]
-the Small Talk Round. -The what now?

[04:45]
[dramatic music plays over speakers]

[04:47]
Thirty seconds on the clock. BoJack, how are you?

[04:50]
-Uh, fine? -Correct.

[04:53]
-Did you see the game last night? -No, I don't follow--

[04:55]
-[Peanutbutter] Oh. -[buzzer sounds]

[04:56]
Oh, so sorry. It says here you did see the game.

[04:59]
[buzzer sounds]

[05:00]
-What game? -[J.D.] Ready camera one? Camera one.

[05:01]
You tell me. You're the one who saw it.

[05:03]
-[audience laughs] -I don't--

[05:04]
-[woman screams] God, no! -[BoJack gasps]

[05:07]
-What the--? -That noise means

[05:09]
it's time for your first General Knowledge question.

[05:12]
Audience, does BoJack know things?

[05:14]
[audience] Let's find out!

[05:17]
BoJack, what is the average annual rainfall in Bora Bora?

[05:21]
-Uh, this is general knowledge? -It's just an average we're asking for.

[05:24]
-I don't know, seven? -Wrong! So wrong.

[05:28]
Wow, when it comes to Bora Bora,

[05:30]
maybe this celebrity should have studied more-a more-a.

[05:33]
[J.D.] Yes, Mr. Peanutbutter. Go for the kill.

[05:36]
-That doesn't really seem-- -[woman] They're all dead!

[05:39]
I watched them die!

[05:41]
-What is--? -Oh-ho. That sound means

[05:42]
it's time to pick your category.

[05:44]
"Trigonometry." "Advanced Physics," and "At the Movies With Mr. Peanutbutter."

[05:50]
At the Movies With Mr. Peanutbutter.

[05:52]
Good choice. After seeing J.J. Abrams' Star Trek reboot, did I call it:

[05:56]
A, "A visual feast for the senses,"

[05:59]
B, "A zestful lark through time and space,"

[06:02]
C, "The best Zachary Quinto movie of all time,"

[06:05]
or D, "All of the above"?

[06:07]
-I'll say D? -Ouch, the answer was A and B.

[06:11]
Though I would also agree with C.

[06:13]
So I told Mr. Peanutbutter I'd drive him here,

[06:16]
and next thing I know, I'm an Associate Producer.

[06:19]
Stupid me. I went to Stanford.

[06:21]
Next time I'll just try that thing where I'm a huge dumbass

[06:24]
who happens to be friends with Mr. Peanutbutter.

[06:26]
-Yup. -Cool.

[06:27]
Well, have fun watching me win that pen.

[06:29]
I don't need a pen.

[06:30]
I can walk into any Chili's with a child under 12 and get crayons for free.

[06:35]
You don't get it.

[06:37]
If Salinger gives you his pen, that means you're worth something.

[06:39]
It means you're a serious person who's going places.

[06:42]
Actually, you know what? Don't worry about it. It's not for you.

[06:46]
[groans]

[06:48]
I'm gonna go with nuclear fusion.

[06:50]
-[buzzer sounds] -Oh, the answer is Egypt.

[06:53]
Turn up the directional heat lamps. Oh, yeah.

[06:55]
Let's really make him sweat.

[06:58]
Surprised you didn't get that one,

[07:00]
since you're an expert when it comes to de-Nile.

[07:04]
Quick impression. [drinks] "I'm not an alcoholic."

[07:06]
[laughs] You love it.

[07:09]
Oh, yeah, pretty good one from King Mutt over here. Am I right?

[07:13]
You know, like King Tut?

[07:15]
Because we're talking about Egypt? And Mr. Peanutbutter's a mutt, so...

[07:19]
You suck.

[07:21]
I'm a yellow lab, BoJack.

[07:23]
-You could get one thing right tonight. -[audience laughs]

[07:26]
Anyway, let's take a moment to look at the great comments

[07:29]
we've been getting on our second screen app,

[07:31]
now available for download.

[07:32]
And we're out. Fifteen seconds, everybody.

[07:35]
-Hey, how am I doing? -You're kind of being a dick.

[07:37]
Hey, are we at Tony Roma's right now?

[07:39]
Because there's a lot of ribbing going on here.

[07:41]
I'm not ribbing you. I'm telling you, you're--

[07:43]
-And we're back in three, two... -[music plays]

[07:47]
Welcome back.

[07:48]
Will BoJack Horseman go down in show history as our worst contestant ever?

[07:52]
So far, yes.

[07:54]
[audience chuckling]

[07:56]
Wow. J.D., people are loving this show.

[07:58]
Wait till they see this. Mia, get ready to drop the bomb.

[08:03]
[woman] Death from above! [Bojack gasps]

[08:05]
Uh-oh. That sound means it's time to drop "da" bomb.

[08:09]
And yes folks, I said "da," not "the."

[08:12]
What I'm trying to say is, it's a positive bomb.

[08:14]
Audience, let's...

[08:16]
[audience] Drop da bomb!

[08:18]
Did you guys all practice before the show, because--

[08:22]
Ladies and gentlemen, we've had some fun with our little celebrity.

[08:26]
But now, let's meet our big celebrity.

[08:28]
-Big celebrity? -Say hello to...

[08:30]
-Daniel Radcliffe! -Hi, I'm Daniel Radcliffe. Hello.

[08:34]
-Oh, my God! It's Daniel Radcliffe! -[audience cheering]

[08:37]
We'll find out what our big celebrity knows right after this break.

[08:41]
[BoJack groans]

[08:43]
And we're out. Oh, we're cooking now.

[08:47]
Hey, you, you're doing great.

[08:49]
I'm not 100 percent watching

[08:51]
because I'm so engrossed in the second screen experience,

[08:53]
but according to the second screen experience,

[08:55]
other people are loving the show.

[08:57]
You didn't tell me there would be another celebrity.

[08:59]
Well, I had no idea that was coming

[09:01]
but some guy named Dong-Slinger-420 loved the surprise.

[09:05]
He said, "Two dongs way up."

[09:07]
There was no mention of another bigger celebrity in the document you faxed?

[09:10]
I couldn't read it. My fax machine cut it into little strips.

[09:13]
-That sounds like a shredder. -Well, I guess I shredded it to you.

[09:16]
-[iPad chimes] -I gotta deal with this.

[09:17]
If I don't interact with this app every 80 seconds,

[09:20]
it charges my credit card five dollars. Love you.

[09:22]
[mumbling] Ehh... you, too.

[09:24]
Could you get the base a little less pale?

[09:26]
-Hey, Daniel, good to see you. -Always nice to meet a fan.

[09:29]
-No, sorry, I'm not a, uh-- I'm an actor. -Oh, good for you.

[09:33]
It's a dreadful business but hang in there.

[09:35]
No, I already did hang in there. I'm BoJack Horseman?

[09:38]
We've actually met before.

[09:39]
At Chris Martin's holiday party? We stepped outside for a smoke?

[09:42]
-To get away from Chris Martin? -Huh.

[09:44]
You opened up about your fear of success?

[09:46]
I gave you some advice?

[09:48]
You said I was a true friend and you would never forget me?

[09:51]
And you said your name was Chadwick Boseman?

[09:54]
-BoJack Horseman. -Oh, I'm sorry.

[09:56]
When you're as famous as I am, you meet so many people.

[09:59]
Sorry, we need you guys back on set.

[10:01]
You were the second hairdresser's assistant on The Ellen Show

[10:04]
about five years ago. Veronica, right?

[10:06]
-Yeah, that's right. -How was your mother's party in the end?

[10:09]
And we're back in five, four, three, two...

[10:13]
So you never say one, huh?

[10:14]
-Welcome back, America. -[man] We love you, Daniel.

[10:18]
[laughs] So do I. So let's watch our celebrities go... Audience?

[10:21]
[all] Head to head!

[10:24]
How could they possibly know that?

[10:26]
-This is the first episode, right? -[J.D. laughs]

[10:28]
The puppets clap when the puppetmaster pulls the strings.

[10:32]
Hello. Serious, Going-Places Todd at your service.

[10:35]
Hey, look at you, all dressed up for the Dipshit Awards.

[10:38]
You know you're not allowed in Hair and Makeup.

[10:41]
-Are you wearing roller skates? -I'm wearing Heelys.

[10:44]
They're shoes with wheels, for efficiency purposes.

[10:46]
-Now I can be serious faster. -You can also go nowhere faster.

[10:50]
Seeing as I am a professional--

[10:53]
No!

[10:55]
-[buzzer sounds] -Oh, BoJack.

[10:57]
Another embarrassingly wrong answer,

[10:59]
bringing your score down by 80 points and 12 dollars.

[11:03]
Why are we playing for both points and dollars?

[11:06]
-Oh, tough break, B.J. Novak! -My name is--

[11:08]
Our next question is to Mr. Radcliffe.

[11:10]
"What color comes from the combination of blue and yellow?"

[11:14]
I actually know this one.

[11:16]
When I was growing up, my neighbor was a painter.

[11:18]
I remember visiting his flat and watching him work.

[11:21]
Sometimes he would mix together blue paint with yellow paint

[11:24]
and it made an entirely new color.

[11:26]
And that man was Banksy. And that color was green.

[11:28]
-Final answer. -Correct!

[11:31]
You've earned the chance to go for a spin

[11:33]
in our Kia Sportage Cash Grab Booth.

[11:35]
[audience cheering]

[11:37]
Oh, splendid.

[11:39]
And while Daniel's in the booth, BoJack, you have an essay question.

[11:42]
-What? -You'll find a blue book on your podium.

[11:45]
"To what extent was feudalism a cause of the French Revolution?"

[11:48]
-Wait, are you ser-- Oh! -And go!

[11:49]
While BoJack works, let's check out the action

[11:51]
-on our Kia Sportage Cash Grab Booth Cam. -[audience cheers]

[11:56]
-Hey, champ. -What are you doing here?

[11:57]
I'm trying to write an essay.

[11:59]
I came to ask you how you were doing

[12:00]
and then to tell you you're not doing so well.

[12:03]
Why am I getting the hard questions,

[12:04]
while Boy Wizard over there just has to know colors

[12:07]
and literally grab cash out of thin air?

[12:09]
[Daniel laughs] A five! This is so easy!

[12:12]
I think I might be able to help you out. Let me tell you a story.

[12:15]
The year was 2003

[12:17]
and for some reason, everyone was playing poker all of a sudden.

[12:20]
A then-relevant Wilmer Valderrama used to host a weekly how-do-you-do

[12:25]
and all the stars came out to show off their tricks.

[12:28]
There was Lucy Lawless, Lucy Liu, Lori Laughlin, Lisa Loeb,

[12:33]
the dog from Frasier, and at the head of the table?

[12:36]
Big Money himself, Mr. Peanutbutter.

[12:39]
Whoops. Woh-oh.

[12:41]
I thought, "Here's a rube."

[12:44]
[laughs]

[12:45]
But Lady Luck had other plans.

[12:48]
You know what, I got an essay to write,

[12:49]
so if this isn't about the precipitous fall of the French ruling class--

[12:52]
But then I saw, the kid had a tell.

[12:58]
I feel like that story had a lot of unnecessary details in it.

[13:01]
Listen. You have to pay close attention, it's subtle,

[13:04]
but when he gets excited, his ears ever so slightly flop up and give him away.

[13:10]
Well, that's no surprise. Guy's been flopping upwards his whole career.

[13:13]
Mm-hm. Watch the ears.

[13:17]
[horn blows]

[13:18]
Time's up, Daniel.

[13:20]
Whoa, looks like D to the R to the Ad to the Cliffe

[13:24]
just won 54,000 bonus dollars.

[13:27]
And BoJack barely got beyond his thesis statement.

[13:31]
[audience laughing]

[13:32]
[clears throat] "A continent ravaged by war,

[13:34]
coupled with the retreat of the church from secular life..."

[13:37]
-And then it just stops? -[audience laughs]

[13:39]
Oh, that's gonna cost you some serious pesos.

[13:42]
But first, it's time for our Multiple Choice Buzz-In Round.

[13:45]
A buzz-in round? All right.

[13:47]
In is my favorite direction in which to buzz.

[13:49]
Tell me, "How many oak trees are needed

[13:52]
to build an [00:00]h century triple-decker Royal Navy battle ship?

[13:56]
A, 75? B, 1000?

[14:00]
Or C, 3500?"

[14:02]
C! 3500!

[14:04]
-Um, correct. -Uh, what?

[14:06]
-Uh, wow. That's, uh... -[mild applause]

[14:08]
That's actually correct.

[14:10]
How the hell did he know that? What else does he know? Does he know things?

[14:14]
Let's find out.

[14:16]
Quantum tunneling. King Magnus the Second.

[14:20]
Miss Scarlet in the library with the lead pipe.

[14:22]
Sassafras. Butterscotch! Argyle.

[14:25]
-Because seven eight nine. -[buzzes]

[14:28]
What an amazing run. It looks like we've got a tied game.

[14:32]
Which is an exciting surprise.

[14:35]
-Goddamn it, throw to commercial. -We'll be right back.

[14:38]
[lively music playing over speakers]

[14:40]
-Hey. Horshack. What's going on? -What's going on is I'm kicking your ass.

[14:44]
Yeah, you know, you're doing great, but I'm supposed to win.

[14:47]
That was the deal. Plug my movie, win money for charity.

[14:50]
Well, tell Charity she can kiss my ass.

[14:52]
By the way, your girlfriend has a stripper name.

[14:54]
It's not my girlfriend, it's charity.

[15:00]
BoJack, according to this app, you're almost tied.

[15:03]
Oh, you are tied, there's a lag. Congratulations.

[15:06]
Thanks. It was touch and go--

[15:08]
But I'm a little concerned

[15:10]
because it seems like you might actually win,

[15:12]
but everyone on the app is really rooting for Daniel.

[15:15]
People love him.

[15:16]
I guess he was in some movie about a potter or a Pottery Barn or something?

[15:20]
-Are you asking me to throw the game? -You don't care about this game.

[15:23]
The only reason you're here is for me, so maybe you could help me out?

[15:27]
-[sighs] Okay. -You know what?

[15:29]
You're the best, no matter what everybody on this app says.

[15:32]
They say you're the worst. Especially Queefburglar69. He's their leader.

[15:38]
[audience cheering]

[15:40]
And we're back. Contestants, I've got a history question for both of you.

[15:44]
"You may or may not be familiar with a famous racehorse named Secretariat.

[15:50]
In what year did Secretariat win the Triple Crown?"

[15:53]
-[buzzer sounds] -BoJack.

[15:54]
Piece of cake.

[15:56]
Hmm?

[15:58]
[sighs]

[15:59]
Um, 1492?

[16:02]
-[audience and Daniel laughing] -What? No, not even close.

[16:04]
BoJack, aren't you in a movie about Secretariat?

[16:07]
-How could you not know that? -Let's just move on.

[16:11]
Maybe instead, he should be in a movie

[16:13]
about a guy who doesn't know anything about Secretariat. [laughs]

[16:16]
That would not be a good movie.

[16:18]
I mean, more like Secre-terrible.

[16:21]
Damn, Bojangles, you got served.

[16:24]
Do you know anything about Secretariat? You know he was a horse, right?

[16:28]
Oh, wait, did I just spoil it for you?

[16:30]
No wonder my wife had to write your book for you.

[16:33]
Hey, yeah, you know, while we're talking about your wife, I've got a question.

[16:38]
How come your wife flew all the way to war-torn Cordovia

[16:41]
just to get away from you?

[16:42]
[people murmuring]

[16:43]
That's not what happened. She went to help people.

[16:46]
Or maybe she went to help herself get away from her awful marriage.

[16:49]
[audience gasping]

[16:50]
-Oh, was that too far? -Oh-ho, you want to get into things?

[16:54]
-Well, I mean-- -No, no, no, let's get into things.

[16:57]
Let's get real. Everybody, BoJack wants to get real.

[17:01]
Cancel the Bubble Round. Because we're getting real.

[17:05]
[production assistant sighs]

[17:06]
Should we cut to commercial?

[17:08]
Would Homer cut away from Odysseus's journey

[17:10]
just as he was being enticed by the sirens' song?

[17:13]
No?

[17:15]
Well, there you are.

[17:16]
Things are getting real out here. Really real.

[17:19]
Really, really, really real!

[17:22]
[audience member clears throat]

[17:24]
-Uh, I'm not sure where you're going-- -Oh, no?

[17:26]
You knew where you were going with my wife

[17:28]
that time you pulled over by the side of the road.

[17:31]
-You know, a week before we got married? -Uh...

[17:33]
You want to talk about that, BoJack?

[17:35]
You want to talk about the time when you, my "good friend," kissed my wife?

[17:40]
-No! -Yes.

[17:42]
Did something exciting just happen?

[17:43]
Because people on the app are, and I quote, "losing their tits."

[17:47]
Oh, no, no, I've stumbled on to a cancer support message board.

[17:50]
Okay, how do I...?

[17:51]
How did you know about that?

[17:53]
Well, there are roadside cameras all along the PCH,

[17:56]
I have a few friends in the highway patrol,

[17:58]
and she told me, of course! We're married!

[18:00]
Wait, so you've known all this time?

[18:03]
Now this is television. Turn on the rain.

[18:06]
Um, don't you think you're pushing them too far?

[18:09]
I'll tell you when it's too far. This is my art, goddamn it.

[18:12]
I'm J. goddamn D. goddamn Salinger, and I want rain!

[18:17]
[thunder rumbling]

[18:20]
All I ever wanted was to be your friend.

[18:23]
And you treat me like a big joke.

[18:26]
You think I don't notice? Why don't you like me?

[18:28]
-Mr. Peanutbutter-- -No, tell me.

[18:31]
-Because... I'm jealous. -Oh.

[18:34]
-Of what? Diane? -No.

[18:37]
Of everything. Everything comes so easy for you.

[18:40]
Oh, and it doesn't for you?

[18:42]
You're a millionaire movie star with a girlfriend who loves you,

[18:45]
acting in your dream movie. What more do you want?

[18:49]
What else could the universe possibly owe you?

[18:52]
I want to feel good about myself.

[18:56]
The way you do. And I don't know how.

[19:00]
I don't know if I can.

[19:02]
Whoa, guys, this is getting a little heavy, don't we think?

[19:05]
I'm sorry, Mr. Peanutbutter.

[19:07]
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

[19:09]
Wow, um, I don't know if I can forgive you.

[19:14]
But I guess we'll find out right after this break.

[19:18]
[audience cheering]

[19:19]
-Damn. -Shut up.

[19:22]
[all cheering]

[19:24]
I knew it. I knew this show would bring us to the heights of human drama

[19:28]
more powerfully than literature ever dreamed.

[19:30]
Now somebody go out and get me a Red Bull and a banana fish sandwich.

[19:34]
On it. It's a perfect day for a Red Bull.

[19:37]
Whoa-oh!

[19:39]
-Mr. Peanutbutter! -Oh, hey Wanda.

[19:41]
I'm only half paying attention to whatever you two are arguing about

[19:44]
but it's killer. Now all we need is a happy ending.

[19:47]
I don't think we can just resolve everything cleanly in a half-hour.

[19:50]
Uh, this is network television.

[19:52]
So resolving everything cleanly in a half-hour is kind of what we do.

[19:56]
You want to host a game show where everyone feels bad at the end?

[20:00]
You can get in your little car, drive to Santa Monica and pitch it to AMC.

[20:03]
But these people want resolution, okay?

[20:06]
So you get your little butt back on that stage and you resolve.

[20:11]
-Uh... -[audience applauding]

[20:13]
And we're back.

[20:15]
You know, I did some thinking over the break. BoJack--

[20:18]
-[electricity powers down] -[audience gasps]

[20:20]
-What's going on? -Oh, my God.

[20:21]
No! No! What's happening?

[20:23]
-[all chattering] -Oh.

[20:27]
[electricity powers up]

[20:29]
Someone unplugged the main power line and plugged in a George Foreman Grill.

[20:33]
Panini time. Hey, who unplugged--

[20:36]
Todd! Goddamnit, step aside!

[20:39]
Mia, good work. You saved the show.

[20:42]
You earned my respect... and this pen.

[20:46]
-Oh, thank you. -[all cheering]

[20:49]
Aww.

[20:51]
Oh, are we back? We're back! Live television, folks.

[20:55]
You know, during the break, my producers told me

[20:58]
I had to forgive BoJack live on the air.

[21:00]
[audience booing]

[21:02]
But I'm my own dog.

[21:04]
And as my own dog, I decided

[21:06]
to forgive BoJack live on the air! Bring it in, buddy!

[21:10]
-What? -Really?

[21:11]
Mr. Peanutbutter, I applaud your forgiving nature,

[21:14]
but this guy kissed your wife.

[21:17]
Wait, BoJack kissed Diane?

[21:19]
The only way to even the score is if you get to kiss him.

[21:23]
-Wait, what? -You're right, it makes perfect sense.

[21:26]
-Yeah, absolutely. -No, it doesn't.

[21:28]
That way Diane and I will have had the same experience.

[21:30]
It's the only way we can move past this.

[21:33]
[sighs]

[21:33]
Well, if it helps us move past this, I guess...

[21:36]
[Daniel and audience] Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

[21:40]
[J.D.] Cue the Kiss Cam.

[21:43]
[love song playing over speakers]

[21:48]
Oh, if only I'd had a Kiss Cam for Catcher In The Rye.

[21:52]
Well, just one more regret on a long list of many.

[21:57]
Todd, there you are. You're missing a pretty big moment out there.

[22:01]
I don't care. You said it yourself. Without that pen, I'm totally worthless.

[22:06]
Not for nothing, but you were worthless before you didn't get the pen.

[22:10]
I really tried this time. I guess I'll never really amount to anything.

[22:16]
Well, maybe you just need someone to believe in you.

[22:20]
Wow, no one's ever fallen for that!

[22:24]
-What? -You're so stupid!

[22:26]
You had the pen and you just gave it to me?!

[22:30]
Oh, I can't believe that worked.

[22:32]
Oh, my God, look at your stupid face.

[22:36]
The pen is just a symbol. It doesn't--

[22:38]
Yeah, said the girl who doesn't have a pen right now.

[22:41]
Unbelievable. You are the most annoying, immature, aggravating,

[22:45]
irritating, crazy-making...

[22:47]
Oh, she was mad, all right. But kids?

[22:51]
That's the story of how I met... this pen.

[22:55]
[laughs]

[22:56]
Hey, get out of Hair and Makeup and give me back my pen!

[22:59]
I got your pen. That means you respect me.

[23:02]
-No it does not. -Viva Todd-foolery!

[23:05]
Suck a dick, dumbshits.

[23:06]
-Hey! Hey, hey! -[blows raspberry]

[23:08]
-[lively music playing over speakers] -[audience cheering]

[23:11]
Well, that stern but supple kiss puts you over the top.

[23:14]
BoJack Horseman is tonight's winner.

[23:17]
[dog howls]

[23:19]
-Well played, Jock-jam Door-slam. -[groans]

[23:21]
You've earned $500,000 for charity.

[23:24]
You can walk away right now or, and remember, this is for charity,

[23:29]
you can risk it all in our Double or Nothing round.

[23:32]
[audience clamoring]

[23:35]
I wanna risk it all!

[23:36]
All right. Now that's $500,000.

[23:40]
If you get this question right, you double that,

[23:42]
a million dollars for charity.

[23:44]
But if you get it wrong, the charity gets nothing

[23:46]
and all the money will be set on fire live here on our studio soundstage.

[23:51]
BoJack, for all the marbles:

[23:54]
"Which famous actor played the titular role

[23:57]
in the popular Harry Potter film franchise?"

[24:00]
-[audience] Oh. -Huh.

[24:03]
Yeah. I don't know.

[24:05]
When you're as famous as I am, you meet so many people,

[24:08]
it's impossible to remember them all.

[24:10]
Okay, I get what you're doing. Very funny.

[24:13]
Yeah. Oh, what is that guy's name?

[24:16]
You know, it's on the tip of my tongue?

[24:18]
Are you serious right now? Dude, this is for charity.

[24:21]
-BoJack, we need an answer. -Yeah, I don't know.

[24:24]
Gosh, I wanna say...

[24:28]
-Elijah Wood? -What?

[24:32]
Elijah Wood?!
