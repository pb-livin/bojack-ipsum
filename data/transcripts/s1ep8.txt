[00:05]
[BoJack] Oh, right.

[00:06]
Well, just tell whoever, then.

[00:08]
- Haaah! - [tires screech]

[00:09]
Ooh!

[00:11]
[honks horn]

[00:13]
- Asshole! - [tires squeal]

[00:15]
Anyway, I'm off to Malibu to see Herb Kazzaz.

[00:18]
He has cancer, which, as you know, is a whole thing.

[00:20]
Plus, he hates me, so I could really use

[00:22]
some good news at the end of the day.

[00:24]
Oh, my God. You're going to see Herb?

[00:25]
You must be really-- Nope.

[00:28]
- Don't care. Not interested. - [phone beeps]

[00:30]
Okay, Good talk.

[00:32]
Hey.

[00:35]
- Ready for this? - Listen.

[00:36]
I want to make sure I don't spend

[00:37]
any time alone with Herb.

[00:39]
I'm bringing you along as my buffer.

[00:40]
And your memoirist.

[00:42]
I should meet your old best friend

[00:43]
before he dies of cancer.

[00:44]
Fine, I guess.

[00:45]
Just don't abandon me.

[00:46]
No bathroom breaks.

[00:48]
And don't slip out of the room

[00:49]
to text your fiancé a bunch of winky smileys

[00:52]
with hearts next to them-- Gross.

[00:55]
Congratulations on the whole being engaged thing,

[00:57]
- by the way. - Thanks.

[00:58]
It's just starting to hit me.

[01:00]
I'm getting married.

[01:01]
Thank God I don't have to die alone.

[01:03]
- No offense. - None taken.

[01:04]
Till you said, "No offense."

[01:06]
So what's the deal with you and this guy?

[01:08]
You never talk about him.

[01:10]
Well, I kind of, maybe stabbed him in the back.

[01:13]
Yeah, it's a bit of a story.

[01:16]
A story of power, betrayal, and ambitious hairstyles.

[01:21]
The year? 198--

[01:22]
- Movie's over. - Watch the next one.

[01:25]
Aw, I'm tired of watching movies.

[01:28]
- Do you want to play a game? - Sure.

[01:30]
I spy with my little eye someone who needs

[01:33]
to shut the hell up.

[01:34]
- Is it me? - It's always you.

[01:36]
- Now, where was I? - You were about to tell

[01:38]
a story about you being a shitty friend,

[01:40]
but then, we got interrupted by you yelling at Todd.

[01:42]
Oh, yeah. Shut up, Todd.

Do we really need a toilet and a sink

[03:01]
and a bathtub and-- Wait, hold on--

A whole 'nother room with another sink?

[03:06]
They're all just holes to the ocean, lady.

[03:07]
I mean, come on.

[03:08]
[laughs]

[03:10]
BoJack, you're late.

[03:11]
Here. I got you a beer. It's on the house.

[03:13]
Don't tell my boss.

[03:15]
Thanks, Charlotte, but one beer gets me tipsy.

[03:17]
I got to be clear-headed for my set.

[03:18]
Looks like Herb's killing.

[03:20]
Yeah, and the suits from ABC are here.

[03:22]
[laughter]

[03:23]
Look. They're nodding.

[03:25]
That's the executive version of laughing.

[03:26]
Wow. They must be serious about Herb.

[03:29]
That's Angela Diaz.

[03:31]
She's the woman who made pantsuits a thing.

[03:33]
Oh, before I forget.

[03:34]
Herb and I are gonna see

[03:36]
Back to the Future again this weekend.

[03:37]
- Want to come? - I'm in.

[03:38]
That movie was amazing,

[03:40]
except for all the lame time period jokes.

[03:41]
We get it. The '50s were different.

[03:43]
I'll have a New Coke, please.

[03:45]
Listen, you guys don't need to include me on your dates.

[03:48]
Sometimes, it makes me feel like a third wheel.

[03:50]
BoJack, stop.

[03:51]
Without the third wheel,

[03:53]
how would you ride a tricycle?

[03:54]
Wouldn't that make it a bicycle?

[03:56]
Herb Kazzaz, ladies and gentlemen.

[03:57]
[applause]

[03:58]
- Hey-ooh! - Great set, man.

[04:00]
It's like everything you said was something

[04:01]
I've thought before but never had the balls to say.

[04:04]
Thanks, BJ. I set 'em up.

[04:05]
Now, you knock 'em down.

[04:07]
Let's give it up for BoJack Horseman.

[04:09]
- [applause] - Well, thank you, Bubbles.

[04:12]
I love L.A. Don't you guys?

[04:14]
The prettiest girls in the world flock to this city,

[04:17]
and they end up with total knobs.

[04:18]
Take this couple, for example.

[04:20]
[laughter]

[04:21]
Excuse me, miss. Is that your date?

[04:23]
He's my husband.

[04:24]
That's your husband? You can do better.

[04:26]
Give me a call after the show.

[04:28]
- [laughter] - I'm just kidding around.

[04:31]
[whispers] I'm not kidding around.

[04:33]
[laughter]

[04:36]
Ugh.

[04:38]
Maker's Manhattan? 2:00 P.M.?

[04:39]
Not judging.

[04:41]
That guy tipped me a quarter.

[04:43]
That's barely enough money to buy three gallons of gas.

[04:45]
- You want a slug? - No, I got to stay sharp.

[04:47]
I got another audition this afternoon.

[04:49]
God, I can't wait till I'm finally up

[04:51]
for real jobs instead of these dumb commercials.

[04:53]
"Here's the thing about most long-distance plans."

[04:56]
Ugh. I hate when people say that.

[04:58]
- "Here's the thing." - It's so stupid.

[05:00]
Just say the thing.

[05:02]
You don't need to introduce the concept

[05:04]
that there's going to be a thing.

[05:06]
I don't expect to be offered Secretariat

[05:08]
right away, but when am I gonna be up

[05:10]
for real roles?

[05:11]
We'll get there, BJ. We both will.

[05:13]
In fact, if I play my cards right,

[05:15]
I might get there real soon.

[05:16]
Wait.

[05:17]
- Did the guys from ABC call? - Uh-huh.

[05:19]
They invited me to some hotshot event

[05:21]
at LACMA this weekend.

[05:23]
I'm gonna pitch 'em a TV show while they're drunk.

[05:26]
An off-the-clock, non-work-related social event?

[05:29]
That's the perfect time to pitch a TV show.

[05:31]
You're brilliant.

[05:32]
These people are so fancy.

[05:34]
Look, look, look. Hey, hey, look.

[05:35]
That's Joyce DeWitt, isn't it?

[05:37]
That's Joyce DeWitt. And that's Angela Diaz.

[05:39]
And that's Ubu, the guy who sits.

[05:41]
- He is a good dog. - [Ubu barks]

[05:44]
Guys, don't take your eyes off the prize.

[05:46]
We need to fill Charlotte's bag with these mini quiches.

[05:48]
This is our breakfast for June.

[05:50]
- Herb Kazzaz. - Shit, we're busted.

[05:51]
- [plate shatters] - Pretend you don't speak English.

[05:53]
Buongiorno. Bon Jovi.

[05:55]
Salutations. Crap, that's English.

[05:57]
Hey, you mind if I steal this superstar for a second?

[05:59]
Okay, yeah. I'll catch you two later.

[06:01]
Stay out of trouble. Oh, ho.

[06:02]
Well, there he goes.

[06:04]
Herb's about to hit the big time,

[06:05]
and I'm just gonna be a small-fry

[06:07]
doing tiny commercials and eating mini quiches.

[06:09]
You're dead wrong.

[06:10]
You're gonna be a big success.

[06:12]
Herb says that to me all the time.

[06:13]
- He thinks the world of you. - He does?

[06:16]
Yeah, I'm not worried about if you'll become a star.

[06:18]
I'm more worried about how you'll change when it happens.

[06:21]
Like, you think I'll get fat?

[06:22]
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

[06:25]
So you're saying I definitely

[06:26]
- won't get fat? - No.

[06:27]
Well, make up your mind, lady.

[06:28]
Look over there. See those tar pits?

[06:31]
Hollywood's a real pretty town

[06:33]
that's smack on top of all that black tar.

[06:35]
By the time you realize you're sinking,

[06:37]
it's too late.

[06:38]
Wait, is this a science lesson?

[06:40]
No, BoJack, it's a metaphor.

[06:42]
- Ugh, that's worse. - BoJack, I'm moving to Maine.

[06:45]
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Really?

[06:46]
- Does Herb know? - Yeah.

[06:49]
I don't think I'm the person Herb's looking for.

[06:51]
I'm going to miss you, Charlotte.

[06:53]
Hey, do you ever wonder what would have happened

[06:56]
if you'd met me before Herb did?

[06:58]
Would you have made a move on me?

[06:59]
- Charlotte-- - I don't think you would have.

[07:01]
You know why?

[07:03]
I think you're a coward.

[07:05]
Now go stuff some prosciutto in your pants

[07:07]
before that Webster kid takes it all.

[07:08]
[upbeat music]

[07:10]
[Herb] I love this town.

[07:13]
Why did you bring me to Griffith Park?

[07:15]
Are we gonna get in a knife fight

[07:16]
like in Rebel Without a Cause?

[07:18]
- I hate that title. - He had several causes.

[07:20]
I wanted to give you this.

[07:22]
Look out at that city.

[07:24]
What do you see?

[07:25]
Wow, I didn't realize

[07:27]
there were so many day hookers.

[07:28]
I see a city that you and I

[07:30]
will run someday, and when we're both famous

[07:32]
and have everything we've ever wanted,

[07:34]
we'll come back here together and high five.

[07:37]
I'm not fully on board with this new high five thing.

[07:39]
What ever happened to the low five?

[07:41]
Give me some skin.

[07:43]
BJ, listen. I got a call from ABC today.

[07:45]
They bought my TV pitch.

[07:46]
What? That's amazing.

[07:48]
- What's the show? - It's called Horsin' Around.

[07:52]
Well, good luck on your rocket ship

[07:53]
to the top without me.

[07:55]
No, BoJack, the show's about a horse,

[07:57]
and I told those suits if they want my show,

[07:59]
then that horse is gonna be BJ Goddamn Horseman.

[08:02]
- Oh, my God. - And they said, "No."

[08:04]
- Oh. - And I said, "Please?"

[08:06]
And they said, "Okay."

[08:07]
So, what do you say?

[08:09]
- Want to be my star? - Seriously?

[08:11]
Of course I do. Of course, Herb.

[08:13]
Jesus Christ, thank you.

[08:15]
Mm-hmm-- Whoa, whoa.

[08:17]
I think you got the wrong idea here.

[08:18]
- Yeah, no, man. Whoa. - Herb, I'm not--

[08:20]
Me either. No, I just-- You know,

[08:22]
- I caught up in the moment. - Yeah, no, I gotcha.

[08:25]
BJ, can you believe it?

[08:26]
We're gonna make an actual TV show!

[08:29]
One that takes an unflinching look

[08:31]
at the gritty reality of the American family.

[08:35]
Just kidding. Let's get rich!

[08:37]
[both] Yeah.

[08:56]
and then, in the very next scene,

[08:58]
I'm wearing the sweater?

[08:59]
Did my character suddenly forget

[09:01]
that he didn't want to wear the sweater?

[09:03]
No, see, that's actually the joke.

[09:04]
Don't explain the joke to me.

[09:05]
I just don't understand how it's a joke.

[09:07]
So you do want me to explain it to you?

[09:09]
I want you to add a scene showing

[09:11]
how I changed my mind about the sweater

[09:12]
so the goddamn episode makes sense.

[09:14]
Look at me, doing your job for you.

[09:16]
Way to go, Shakespeare.

[09:17]
BJ, you're doing the scene as written.

[09:19]
What happened to the stories I requested?

[09:22]
Where's my rap? You said you'd write me a rap.

[09:24]
We're working on it.

[09:26]
We just need a rhyme for "and I'm here to say."

[09:28]
Well, what about giving me Rollerblades?

[09:29]
How are people gonna know that my character is hip

[09:31]
if he doesn't roll the blade?

[09:33]
Just get out there and do your job.

[09:35]
Every one of your ideas is stupid or racist.

[09:37]
That was one pitch,

[09:39]
and I didn't say they're all thieves.

[09:40]
But if you're too scared to start

[09:42]
a national dialogue, maybe I'll take my ideas home.

[09:44]
Good luck making Horsin' Around without the horse.

[09:46]
BoJack, hon.

[09:48]
That audience out there traveled from all over

[09:50]
the country just to taste some of your magic.

[09:53]
Do you really want to disappoint them?

[09:54]
[sighs] Okay, Sharona.

[09:56]
I'll go out and jerk this limp script

[09:59]
until it gets hard,

[10:00]
but I'm not doing it for Herb.

[10:02]
I'm doing it for the fans.

[10:03]
And your 30K an episode.

[10:05]
[announcer] Let's give it up for BoJack Horseman!

[10:07]
And there better be some Zimas

[10:09]
in my dressing room after the show.

[10:11]

[10:14]
Wait a minute. This isn't the bar.

[10:16]
I got to fire my assistant.

[10:24]
Oh, gross. Why do I keep trying to like Zima?

[10:26]
[phone rings]

[10:28]
- Talk to me, world. - BoJack, it's Princess Carolyn.

[10:31]
How are you doing today?

[10:32]
Well, I'll tell you my problem.

[10:34]
- I just keep getting handsomer. - [laughs]

[10:36]
Good problems to have.

[10:38]
Hold for a sec.

[10:43]
I got some news so good, you'll goddamn kiss me.

[10:48]

[10:49]
What's the role you've been dying

[10:51]
to play your whole life,

[10:53]
besides Kathy Ireland's bathing suit?

[10:55]
Ha-ha. She is attractive.

[10:58]

[11:05]
What's the big news?

[11:08]
It's happening, and it's down

[11:11]
to you and Val Kilmer for the title role.

[11:14]
That's amazing.

[11:15]
Thank you. Thank you.

[11:16]
Now, listen.

[11:18]
I don't want to see you in any more tabloids.

[11:20]
Keep your head down and your nose clean.

[11:23]
Now, I gotta go.

[11:24]
I got a lunch with MC Skat Kat.

[11:29]
[man on TV] Scandal breaking today

[11:31]
surrounding the family sitcom, Horsin' Around.

[11:33]
Oh, God. What did I do this time?

[11:35]
Herb Kazzaz, the show's creator,

[11:37]
was caught tonight in an LAPD sting

[11:40]
- on public indecency. - Wha--

[11:42]
Police say Mr. Kazzaz was caught in the middle

[11:43]
of lewd acts with another man.

[11:45]
Conservative groups have been quick to organize.

[11:48]
Horsin' Around is a show for kids.

[11:50]
My family should be able to watch those nubile preteens

[11:53]
without men like perv Kazzaz flaunting

[11:55]
their alternative lifestyles and ruining America.

[11:58]
Sheeeiiiiit.

[12:06]
BoJack, I gotta tell ya.

[12:08]
- I'm gay. - No doy.

[12:10]
I know we haven't been close for the past couple years.

[12:14]
Okay, I'm gonna hold back my "No doys"

[12:15]
because there might be a lot.

[12:16]
But you know me, right?

[12:18]
You know that I'm a good guy.

[12:19]
They're gunning for me at the network,

[12:21]
and if I get kicked off this, I won't recover.

[12:24]
I need to know that you've got my back.

[12:25]
If you threaten to walk, they'll listen to you.

[12:28]
Herb, you picked the worst possible time to--

[12:31]
Hey, you know I wouldn't ask if I didn't need it.

[12:34]
Come on, BoJack.

[12:36]
How'd we get so far apart, huh?

[12:38]
[sighs]

[12:40]
You know what? You can count on me, Herb.

[12:43]
I mean, I wouldn't even be here if it weren't for you.

[12:45]
I knew it! I knew you'd come through.

[12:48]
And when this is all over, we're going

[12:50]
to drive back up to Griffith Park.

[12:51]
I still owe you that high five, right?

[12:54]
Hey, this is a dumb question,

[12:55]
but do you guys ever, like, all link up together

[12:57]
and do, like, a party train or a fun circle?

[12:59]
'Cause I feel like I'd be doing that all the--

[13:01]
Never mind. Stupid question.

[13:02]
Feel stupid for asking that.

[13:04]
- [crowd shouting] - [barking]

[13:07]
Go right ahead.

[13:09]
And then it goes, "I like healthy gums

[13:11]
in a major way."

[13:12]
See, that's what I'm talking about.

[13:14]
That's great.

[13:15]
We just gotta make sure that we work in the phrase

[13:17]
"toothbrush rap" early, so they know I'm rapping.

[13:22]
BoJack, can we chat for a second?

[13:25]
Ugh. Here we go. It's the big one.

[13:29]
I'm not gonna waste your time with small talk

[13:31]
because you work for me, and your time is my time.

[13:34]
We're letting Herb go.

[13:35]
- You can't do that. - "I can't do that."

[13:37]
I'm not asking you. It's nothing personal.

[13:39]
I like Herb. I think he's a good guy.

[13:41]
But this is a business, and every day

[13:43]
we don't fire him, we're flushing money

[13:44]
- down the crapper. - Well, if he goes, I go.

[13:46]
"Well, if he goes, you go." I wouldn't do that.

[13:47]
BoJack, I think you're a star,

[13:49]
and sometimes being a star means making tough choices.

[13:52]
You can storm out, make a big show out of

[13:54]
what a "good" friend you are,

[13:56]
or you could be the guy who does his job.

[13:58]
- Angela-- - I'll tell you when

[13:59]
it's your turn to talk again.

[14:01]
Look, you're a star, but this is really just

[14:03]
the beginning of the BoJack Horseman story.

[14:05]
You can choose whatever path you want,

[14:08]
but I'll tell you right now.

[14:09]
You don't win awards and you don't

[14:11]
get to be on the covers of magazines

[14:13]
and you don't get to play the lead role

[14:15]
in the Secretariat movie by being a good friend.

[14:18]
What's that old expression about how the show must go on?

[14:20]
Oh, right. It's "Don't be an idiot."

[14:23]
So what do you think, BoJack? That's a courtesy question.

[14:26]
I already know what you think because I have conversations

[14:29]
like this one five times a day.

[14:31]
I know who you are, and I know

[14:33]
you've already made your decision.

[14:34]
But if you want to surprise me,

[14:35]
now's the time to do it.

[14:37]
That's what I thought.

[14:39]
You're doing the right thing. I know it's hard.

[14:41]
But if Herb's really your friend, he'll understand.

[14:43]
Now, you've got a show to put on,

[14:45]
so I'll let you get ready.

[14:46]
This was a good conversation. Productive.

[14:49]
If you're lucky, I'll never talk to you again.

[14:52]
[cup thuds]

[14:54]
[sighs]

[14:57]
[announcer] You folks ready for a show?

[14:59]
[audience cheering]

[15:00]
'Cause I think a certain someone

[15:02]
might show up any second.

[15:04]
[applause]

[15:08]
[sighs]

[15:11]
- [cheers and applause] - Wait a minute.

[15:13]
This isn't the bar.

[15:14]
I gotta fire my assistant.

[15:16]
[laughter]

[15:20]
So what ended up happening with Secretariat?

[15:23]
Went into turnaround.

[15:25]
I don't totally know what "turnaround" means,

[15:26]
- but they never made the movie. - Whoa.

[15:29]
This house is way bigger than yours.

[15:32]
Herb's done really well for a guy you dicked over.

[15:35]
- Oh, no. Ah. - That's enough out of you.

[15:37]
Stay out here and turn this car around

[15:39]
in case we need to leave in a hurry.

[15:40]
Hooray. A task.

[15:42]
[doorbell rings]

[15:44]
[sighs]

[15:45]
[coughs]

[15:47]
BoJack! Well.

[15:49]
Jesus, you look shitty.

[15:51]
Have you been eating your guilt this whole time?

[15:53]
[all laugh]

[15:57]
Yeah, you don't look so hot yourself, Herb.

[15:59]
I have cancer.

[16:02]
And hello. Who's this stunning creature?

[16:04]
And what string of bad decisions

[16:06]
has placed you in BoJack's orbit?

[16:08]
- Uh-- - This is Diane.

[16:09]
She's writing a book about me.

[16:11]
Pleasure to meet you.

[16:12]
Is your book called, Portrait of an Asshole?

[16:15]
[laughs] I kid.

[16:16]
It's funny, because he ruined my life.

[16:18]
I joke. It's what I do.

[16:20]
Please, come in.

[16:21]
You're letting out all the cancer.

[16:22]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

[16:23]
[forced laugh]

[16:25]
Ha ha...

[16:26]
Almost. Ah...

[16:28]
Almost there.

[16:30]
Come on... ah.

[16:32]
- Oh, thanks. Thanks. - [bear growls]

[16:35]
BoJack, how are your utensils?

[16:38]
- Uh, they're fine. - Are you sure?

[16:39]
Because if that knife ain't sharp enough,

[16:41]
I got another that you left in my back 20 years ago.

[16:44]
- [laughs] - Could have seen that coming.

[16:46]
Who asks about utensils?

[16:47]
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

[16:48]
Nope. No, you are not.

[16:50]
Uh.

[16:52]
Oh. Ow. Almost.

[16:54]
[exciting music]

[16:56]
- Drive, drive, drive! - Oh. Oh, no.

[16:58]
I can't turn the car around.

[16:59]
I've been trying to do this three-point turn forever.

[17:02]
I mean, it's more like a 300-point turn.

[17:04]
- Am I right, huh? - Hee hee hee hee!

[17:06]
Hey, we've got two sacks

[17:07]
of Kardashian swag and the fuzz on our heels.

[17:09]
You think this is Driver's Ed, you hat-wearing pussy?

[17:12]
Drive the goddamn car!

[17:15]
[coughs]

[17:19]
Hey, Herb,

[17:20]
is that your Vitamix?

[17:22]
BoJack has one, too.

[17:23]
I wonder if you guys have

[17:24]
strong opinions about it one way or the other.

[17:28]
Well, the stupid thing was like 600 bucks.

[17:29]
I have used mine a grand total of zero times.

[17:31]
I got it a month before I was diagnosed with cancer.

[17:34]
I don't give a shit about being healthy anymore.

[17:36]
I don't even have cancer, and I don't use it.

[17:37]
- So who's it for? - Exactly.

[17:39]
What is so great about liquids?

[17:41]
Every article I read now is "juice this" and "juice that."

[17:44]
You know why? Juice controls the media.

[17:46]
- Hey-ooh. - [both laugh]

[17:49]
Can't this thing go any faster?

[17:51]
Uh, I'm going as fast as I can.

[17:54]
[tires squealing]

[17:56]
Do you want me to get out? Try to guide you?

[17:58]
No, I think I'm almost there.

[17:59]
You're doing a great job.

[18:01]
Kenzie, stop talking to him.

[18:03]
Why? He's being nice.

[18:05]
Remember the number one rule

[18:06]
of the Celebrity Stealing Club--

[18:08]
- "No falling in love." - Ugh.

[18:10]
That's your rule for every club.

[18:12]
It's a good rule.

[18:14]
Whoa. Whoa, guys.

[18:16]
I'm sensing a lot of hostility here.

[18:18]
Maybe we should take our masks off and actually talk.

[18:22]
You want me to take my mask off? Fine.

[18:25]
Happy? I took my mask off.

[18:27]
Did you?

[18:28]
Because I think you're still wearing a mask.

[18:32]
[both] Oh.

[18:34]
Oh, my God, Herb, you met President Clinton?

[18:37]
Oh, yeah. Many times.

[18:38]
Did you think that I spent the last 20 years

[18:40]
on my couch just feeling sorry for myself?

[18:41]
I mean, I did do that, but I also started...

[18:44]
[coughs] a charity to bring clean water

[18:46]
to millions of children in Sub-Saharan Africa.

[18:48]
Oh, wow.

[18:49]
I presented at the Teen Choice Awards.

[18:51]
Wait, is that Charlotte?

[18:53]
Yeah, yeah. We kept in touch.

[18:54]
You should actually give her a call.

[18:56]
I'm sure she'd love to hear from you.

[18:57]
She looks good for someone so old.

[18:59]
She's three years younger than you.

[19:00]
- Exactly! - [laughs]

[19:02]
- [coughs] - Er?

[19:04]
Well, guys, I'm pretty beat.

[19:06]
I think I need to head off to bed,

[19:08]
and I hope I actually wake up later.

[19:09]
[coughs]

[19:11]
And it was actually nice to see you, BoJack.

[19:15]
You can see yourselves out.

[19:16]
[chuckling]

[19:18]
"Juice controls the media."

[19:20]
[chuckling] I love it.

[19:24]
So I guess in a sense

[19:26]
I'm running away from the cops,

[19:27]
but I feel like in another, truer sense,

[19:30]
I'm running away from myself.

[19:33]
- Truth. Truth. - Whoa.

[19:35]
Kenzie, do you have anything to share?

[19:37]
Just how amazing it feels to finally

[19:39]
be honest for once.

[19:40]
I could live a million lives,

[19:42]
and I'd never forget this one afternoon.

[19:44]
Word.

[19:45]
You know, I act all cool

[19:46]
and sophisticated on the outside,

[19:48]
but on the inside, I'm just Todd, you know?

[19:52]
But thanks to you guys, I think I'm finally

[19:54]
- ready to let my guard down. - Do you hear that?

[19:55]
- He's letting his guard down. - Let's get him!

[19:58]
- [grunts] - Oh!

[19:59]
[both] Celebrity stealing club strikes again.

[20:01]
[upbeat music]

[20:06]
This-- This just doesn't feel right.

[20:09]
I should have brought a bottle of wine.

[20:11]
That's what adults do. BoJack, damn it.

[20:13]
Is that what's bothering you,

[20:15]
- that you didn't bring wine? - You're right.

[20:17]
I just would have drunk it on the way here.

[20:19]
This isn't about wine, BoJack.

[20:21]
If you have something you need to say to someone,

[20:24]
you should do it while you have the chance

[20:26]
because before you know it, it'll be too late.

[20:29]
Is this one of those things where we're talking

[20:31]
about Herb but we're actually talking about something else?

[20:33]
- No, I was talking about Herb. - Okay, good. Yeah, me, too.

[20:36]
[cheerfully] Hey, buddy!

[20:39]
You come back for that Vitamix, you--

[20:41]
[coughs]

[20:43]
Ooh, you should get that looked at.

[20:45]
Yeah. I've been meaning to see a doctor.

[20:47]
Hey, I wanted to talk to you about... you know.

[20:51]
I feel bad about what happened.

[20:55]
So you're apologizing.

[20:57]
Yes. I'm sorry.

[21:00]
Okay. I don't forgive you.

[21:02]
Herb, I said I'm sorry.

[21:03]
Yeah, and I do not forgive you.

[21:06]
Uh... not sure you get what's happening here.

[21:09]
This could be the last time that you--

[21:11]
No. I'm not gonna give you closure.

[21:14]
You don't get that.

[21:15]
[coughs] You have to live

[21:17]
with the shitty thing you did

[21:18]
for the rest of your life.

[21:20]
You have to know that it's never,

[21:22]
ever going to be okay.

[21:23]
I really think that we'd both

[21:25]
- feel better if we just-- - I'm dying.

[21:27]
I'm not gonna feel better,

[21:29]
and I'm not gonna be your prop so you can feel better.

[21:31]
You have to believe me.

[21:33]
- I did everything I could. - Yeah?

[21:34]
Then why didn't you call me? Huh?

[21:37]
20 years-- You didn't call me.

[21:39]
Look, I-- I wanted to, but I didn't think--

[21:42]
You know what it was like for me?

[21:43]
I had nobody. Everybody left.

[21:45]
I knew all those showbiz phonies would turn on me.

[21:47]
Sure. But you?

[21:48]
It's not my fault you got fired.

[21:50]
I don't care about the job!

[21:52]
I did fine. I had a good life.

[21:55]
But what I needed then was a friend,

[21:57]
and you abandoned me.

[21:59]
And I will never forgive you for that.

[22:03]
Now, get the fuck out of my house.

[22:06]
I--

[22:08]
[sighs]

[22:12]
Hey, this is a dumb question, but the gay thing

[22:14]
and the rectal cancer thing aren't related, are they?

[22:16]
- Get out of here! - Never mind.

[22:17]
Stupid question. Forget I brought it up.

[22:19]
- Huh. - Hey, BJ.

[22:22]
- Put that back, asshole! - No, you gave this to me.

[22:24]
- [growls] - No!

[22:26]
[both grunting]

[22:28]
[Diane] BoJack?

[22:30]
What are you doing? Get off him.

[22:33]
The show was never the same after I left. Admit it.

[22:35]
Some people prefer the later years.

[22:39]
- [growling] - BoJack. Come on.

[22:41]
- [panting] - Thank you for inviting us.

[22:44]
You have a lovely home.

[22:46]
You know what your problem is?

[22:48]
You want to think of yourself as the good guy.

[22:50]
Well, I know you better than anyone,

[22:52]
and I can tell you that you're not.

[22:54]
In fact, you'd probably sleep a lot better at night

[22:58]
if you just admitted to yourself

[22:59]
that you're a selfish goddamn coward

[23:02]
who takes whatever he wants and doesn't give a shit

[23:05]
about who he hurts.

[23:06]
That's you. That's BoJack Horseman.

[23:10]
I don't know why I came here.

[23:13]
Yeah. You do.

[23:16]
[engine revs, tires screech]

[23:18]
[Princess Carolyn] You said you wanted a job.

[23:21]
It doesn't matter. Nothing matters.

[23:24]
Wow. What happened in Malibu?

[23:26]
- I gotta go. - [phone beeps]

[23:28]
Hey, bright side.

[23:30]
At least now you have a good story to tell

[23:32]
at his funeral.

[23:34]
Ugh, God.

[23:48]
I'm not trying to kill the vibe here,

[23:50]
but I've had to pee for, like, three hours.

[23:53]
[sighs]

[23:55]
Look, I won't put what happened today

[23:56]
in the book if you don't want me to.

[23:58]
No, it's okay.

[23:59]
Full truth like we agreed.

[24:01]
Warts and all.

[24:03]
It doesn't matter anyway.

[24:04]
I don't even care what anybody thinks anymore.

[24:06]
Well, for what it's worth,

[24:08]
I think it took a lot of guts

[24:09]
to do what you did back there.

[24:11]
[water lapping]

[24:14]
- Mmm-- - Mm!
