[00:11]
[snoring]

[00:15]
Aw, she looks so peaceful.

[00:17]
Think she's dreaming that she's not overstaying her welcome?

[00:20]
When she got that wine delivered to the house,

[00:22]
I thought that was her thank-you present, that she was leaving,

[00:25]
-but then she just drank the wine. -Five days ago.

[00:28]
-Morning, everybody. -Aah! Kinko!

[00:30]
Another beautiful day in the city of Brotherly Angels.

[00:33]
Todd, I don't recall accidentally ingesting poison,

[00:36]
and yet here you are trying to make me vomit.

[00:39]
You wanna go buy me a kite and then fly a kite?

[00:41]
No. Kites are sky trash.

[00:43]
[groans] Why is it so daytime right now?

[00:48]
Wanda?

[00:49]
[groaning]

[00:50]
Wanna go surf some cloud waves? That's what I call wind.

[00:53]
Sorry. Some of us have jobs.

[00:55]
Not all of us. Just some of us.

[00:58]
Oh, yeah, my job.

[01:02]
-Morning. -[J.D.] What?

[01:03]
I'm done with my sabbatical and I'm ready to get back to work.

[01:07]
What sabbatical? I fired you.

[01:08]
Oh, I thought when you said, "You're fired,"

[01:11]
that was just you "giving me the business."

[01:14]
No, I was taking the "business" away from you.

[01:16]
Oh.

[01:18]
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter. You wanna go fly a kite?

[01:21]
Put me down for a supersized "sounds great."

[01:23]
But with an even larger main course of "sadly, I cannot."

[01:26]
I am swamped here at work. First, I gotta put my suit on.

[01:30]
Then I gotta go to hair and makeup.

[01:32]
Then we record the show.

[01:34]
And then I gotta take my suit off.

[01:36]
So, that's, like, the whole day. Sorry.

[01:39]
[groans]

[01:42]
[groans]

[01:44]
Ah.

[01:45]
"Looking for a friend?"

[01:46]
Yes.

[01:47]
"Need direction?"

[01:48]
I'm listening.

[01:50]
"Try Scientology"?

[01:52]
-Huh. -Excuse me? Sir?

[01:54]
-Huh? -Have you ever thought

[01:56]
about trying improv comedy?

[01:58]
Improv comedy? I don't know...

[02:02]
Why not? It's not like there's anything else to do.

[02:04]
Here on Mars.

[02:06]
We're on Mars?

[02:07]
Yes. And in a Martian ice cream shop. Care for a butterscotch swirl?

[02:12]
Whoa!

[02:13]
The only limit is my imagination.

[02:16]
Why not come by our theater and try a free class?

[02:19]
Okay! Can I bring this food inside the theater?

[02:23]
Ha, good one.

[02:24]
-But no. -Oh.

[02:27]
[♪♪]

[03:24]
"That's when I learned that guns can blow a vato away.

[03:26]
But calculus? Calculus can blow a mind away."

[03:31]
[Abe] Cut!

[03:32]
We got it!

[03:33]
That's the day, everybody.

[03:35]
[slurping]

[03:36]
-You sure we got it, Abe? -Of course. You were phenomenal.

[03:40]
Really? Because that kid sneezed in the middle of my monologue.

[03:43]
-We can fix that in post. -Abe, I'm supposed to tell you

[03:46]
the boom mike fell into the last shot.

[03:48]
You sure you don't wanna get another take? Just for safety?

[03:50]
What am I, Kubrick? We can fix all this stuff in post.

[03:53]
It's an easy scene.

[03:55]
Secretariat's a nice guy, the Spanish kids learn a lesson.

[04:00]
Boom. Bam! Done!

[04:01]
But Secretariat never actually taught math in South Central.

[04:04]
I don't know what Secretariat did or didn't do. I wasn't there.

[04:08]
-Yeah, but-- -Okay, so the studio wants gangbangers,

[04:11]
we'll give them gangbangers.

[04:13]
-We get paid either way, right? -I guess.

[04:15]
I can't wait to get home. I got a coq au vin in the slow cooker.

[04:18]
You like coq au vin?

[04:20]
I think so. Is that the move where a French girl pours soup in--

[04:23]
Come over for dinner, okay?

[04:24]
-You'll love it. -Okay.

[04:26]
Chin up, big guy. So, we ain't making Casablanca.

[04:29]
[slurping]

[04:33]
-BoJack. Shut up. -Aah! What are you--?

[04:35]
No one can know I'm here.

[04:37]
-What? -Shut your stupid mouth, you idiot.

[04:39]
As you know, you're my favorite client.

[04:42]
If I left Vigor, would you follow me to a new agency?

[04:45]
Sure, but no one's gonna hire me after this movie comes out.

[04:48]
The script turned into a piece of shit, and the director is a total hack.

[04:51]
Good guy, total hack.

[04:53]
Let's get you something before the movie comes out.

[04:55]
We got an offer in for this new play off-Broadway.

[04:58]
Theater? That's what real actors do.

[05:00]
Yeah, I told them that, but they said she wanted you.

[05:03]
-She? -Yeah, this hot new playwright Jill Pill.

[05:05]
-She came out of nowhere. -Jill Pill?

[05:07]
New York Magazine called her the enfant terrible

[05:10]
of the immersive theater world,

[05:11]
and then later clarified that that's a compliment.

[05:14]
It sounds like the kind of thing I should be doing now.

[05:16]
-Something artistic and bold. -Rehearsals start in two weeks.

[05:20]
Are you ready to go to New York for six months?

[05:22]
New York's a great city to live in for six months

[05:25]
and not a second longer and only if you're insanely wealthy. I can't wait!

[05:31]
Now, that's a lot of apple sauce.

[05:34]
[all] Apple sauce!

[05:35]
Oh-ho!

[05:37]
That was so funny.

[05:38]
Which one of you guys wrote all those funny jokes?

[05:40]
No, Todd, here at Shenanigags, we make things up on the spot.

[05:45]
-Let's try it. Give me a suggestion. -Uh... I don't know.

[05:48]
Suggestions?

[05:49]
[all laughing]

[05:50]
Your suggestion was "suggestions."

[05:52]
-Way to break the fourth wall. -That wasn't that funny.

[05:55]
My name's Bryan and you haven't won me over yet.

[05:58]
-Oh, Bryan. -Todd, in improv,

[06:00]
we get suggestions from an audience then make up scenes based on them.

[06:03]
There are just a few simple rules. You don't ask questions. You don't say no.

[06:07]
No matter what. When someone makes a suggestion, you always try to build on it.

[06:11]
We call that "yes, and..."

[06:13]
Yes, and if you mess up, that's okay. It's all part of the fun.

[06:18]
Is it really that simple?

[06:19]
Ugh! It's incredibly complicated and requires years of training.

[06:23]
Oh, Bryan.

[06:24]
[all laughing]

[06:26]
But improv isn't just about a constant clamoring for attention and validation.

[06:30]
It's about community.

[06:31]
I've always wanted to be part of a community.

[06:33]
Well, you are now. Your first class is $200.

[06:36]
I thought you said it was free.

[06:38]
Oh, that was just me doing an improv.

[06:44]
I am so proud of you.

[06:46]
Every day I'm telling people all about the great stuff you're doing there.

[06:50]
-Yeah, I don't know-- -And they say, "Wow, she sounds amazing."

[06:53]
And I say, "I'm here to confirm she is an incredible woman."

[06:56]
-Well-- -You know, the sound guy's wife

[06:57]
works with at-risk teens.

[06:59]
And I was like, "Yeah, that's okay, but compared to what my wife is doing,

[07:03]
-your wife is bullshit!" -Oh.

[07:05]
And he had to agree with me.

[07:06]
-Um-- -Because I am his boss.

[07:08]
-Listen-- -Let me talk to one of the locals.

[07:11]
I wanna hear someone else talk about how what a selfless hero my wife is.

[07:14]
-Oh, uh... -Ah, now come on.

[07:16]
-Most refugees got their tongues cut out. -Find one with a tongue.

[07:19]
-I don't think-- -Indulge me.

[07:21]
Okay.

[07:22]
[in softer voice] Hello. I am refugee from village.

[07:26]
Hey, what's your name, Superstar?

[07:29]
Uh, my name is...

[07:35]
Coffee Maker. [groans]

[07:37]
Ah. Kofi Makir. Am I pronouncing that right?

[07:44]
Hey, Todd, you had some killer provs in class today.

[07:47]
Yes, and that zombie dentist scene was so innovative.

[07:51]
Eh...

[07:52]
-Oh, Bryan. -Guys, look.

[07:54]
It's Copernicus.

[07:55]
[all gasp]

[07:56]
-Who's that? -What are you, new?

[07:58]
Yes, I am new.

[07:59]
Copernicus is the founder of Shenanigags.

[08:02]
That guy is the Jan-Ove Waldner of modern improv.

[08:04]
-Who is Jan-Ove Waldner? -The Michael Jordan of table tennis.

[08:07]
Oh.

[08:08]
-Let's go talk to him. -Are you kidding?

[08:11]
You can't just go up and talk to Copernicus.

[08:13]
Man, Todd, you don't know shit. You're just a tourist.

[08:16]
No, I'm not.

[08:17]
If you're one of us, prove it. Go improv that lady over there.

[08:20]
Freestyle.

[08:21]
No audience, no net.

[08:23]
-I don't know... -Hey, if you're down with the prov,

[08:26]
you gotta prove that prov.

[08:28]
All right. I'll do it.

[08:31]
-Hello, old ma'am. -Oh, hello.

[08:34]
I'm just waiting for my friend Doris. Have you seen her?

[08:38]
Yes,

[08:39]
and she exploded?

[08:42]
Doris exploded?

[08:44]
-You just got prov'd! -In your face, lady!

[08:47]
The streets are ours!

[08:48]
-Hurray, improv! I did it! -You have briefly won me over.

[08:54]
Poor Doris...

[08:58]
That is not what I thought coq au vin was. But it's great.

[09:01]
Well, I'm no Emeril Lagasse, but we do get by.

[09:04]
-Oh, stop. [laughs] -Bam!

[09:07]
Like Emeril? Ha, remember that?

[09:09]
He said "bam."

[09:10]
I don't know who Emeril is, but he sounds delightful.

[09:13]
Hey, should I give him a sitcom?

[09:14]
BoJack, Abe tells me you guys are almost done with the movie.

[09:18]
One week left!

[09:20]
You two lovebirds gonna do any traveling or anything?

[09:22]
I'll be traveling back and forth to New York for the next few months

[09:26]
because BoJack's doing a play there after you finish.

[09:29]
-Oh, I love plays. -A play.

[09:30]
That's my favorite place to eat crinkly candies.

[09:32]
Yeah, I can't wait to finally work on something good, you know?

[09:36]
Oh?

[09:37]
Although I gotta hand it to your husband. It has been a really painless shoot,

[09:41]
even though the movie's gonna be a piece of shit, right?

[09:44]
-What? -Oh, you said "piece of ship," right?

[09:46]
Like shipshape? [giggles]

[09:47]
Anyway, what were we talking about? Who knows?

[09:50]
-Okay, moving on. -Hey, it's fine.

[09:52]
Abe knows what we're making.

[09:54]
Right?

[09:55]
[Abe slurps]

[09:56]
-Wanda, would you help me with dessert? -Uh, okay.

[10:01]
Yeah. New York is so great in the summer,

[10:05]
but I don't think we're going to be done in time.

[10:08]
We're looking at a ton of reshoots.

[10:11]
-Are you kidding? -Well, you know,

[10:12]
because the movie's such a piece of shit and all.

[10:16]
Did that hurt your feelings?

[10:17]
I mean, you're the one who said we're not making Casablanca.

[10:20]
Right, because Casablanca is a movie about a club owner named Rick.

[10:24]
This movie's about Secretariat, a racehorse.

[10:27]
Wait, you literally meant we're not making the actual movie Casablanca?

[10:32]
That movie already exists. Why would we make Casablanca?

[10:36]
-This is a different movie. -I think there was a misunderstanding.

[10:40]
Wrong, boy-o. There was a mister-understanding.

[10:43]
And that mister is me understanding you just fine.

[10:47]
You come into my home and you call my work shit?

[10:50]
-You know what I think? You're shit. -What?

[10:52]
You think I don't get enough takes? I'll get more takes.

[10:55]
Just wait, see how many takes I can get.

[10:59]
Well, don't go. We haven't had dessert yet.

[11:03]
Shirley's lemon meringue? Mwah.

[11:05]
I mean, it's no banana cream pie.

[11:09]
Because it's a different kind of pie?

[11:11]
[slurs] That's right.

[11:16]
Why did you have to antagonize him?

[11:18]
I wasn't trying to antagonize him.

[11:19]
-He said, "It's no Casablanca." -Well, what's done is done.

[11:23]
You're happy. You didn't want me to go to New York.

[11:25]
Lucky me, I get to stay here

[11:27]
and work on this movie that's gonna ruin my career.

[11:29]
There's no reason to sulk about it, right?

[11:31]
Or you could sulk about it.

[11:35]
Diane does raise some good points.

[11:36]
No, she doesn't.

[11:37]
Besides, I don't think Diane's the person you wanna be going to for life advice now.

[11:42]
Why? Just because I've been drinking myself to sleep on your deck chairs

[11:45]
and lying to my husband for the last week? Hey, there's a Cheez-It on the shelf.

[11:49]
I knew I kept these things around for a reason.

[11:52]
-I just had the most amazing prov sesh. -No one cares, Todd.

[11:57]
Hey, you guys wanna help me practice? Make a suggestion.

[12:00]
-Stop. -Aah. Sorry, officer,

[12:02]
I didn't see that stop sign.

[12:05]
Yes.

[12:06]
And my car runs on farts.

[12:08]
-[Todd mimics farting] -[Wanda] Ugh!

[12:09]
-Stop. No, stop it. -Please stop.

[12:11]
Not a suggestion.

[12:12]
[mimics farting]

[12:13]
Okay. I just hope I impress the elder council.

[12:16]
I want to become a Level Two,

[12:18]
so I can finally achieve clarity on the Mainstage with the chosen ones.

[12:23]
Oh, shit, Todd's in a cult.

[12:25]
What? No, improv is not a cult.

[12:28]
It's just a dogmatic school of thought

[12:30]
taught by a for-profit organization

[12:32]
with the promise of social and professional opportunities.

[12:35]
-Ahh. -It's a cult. And I know.

[12:37]
I learned a little about cults during that year I was a Scientologist.

[12:42]
Coincidentally during that year, I read a book about cults.

[12:44]
Wait, are you saying Scientology is a cult?

[12:46]
No, Scientology is not a cult.

[12:49]
Improv is a cult.

[12:51]
I wanna be very clear. This is about improv.

[12:55]
-I really don't think it's that bad, guys. -Why does anything matter, right?

[12:59]
Love is an illusion, and happiness is fleeting,

[13:01]
no such thing as God, and all your favorite musicians beat their wives.

[13:04]
Allegedly.

[13:07]
Would you talk to her?

[13:08]
[sighs] Yes.

[13:09]
Yes, and I am a Nazi Kardashian.

[13:13]
Heyyy... Hitler.

[13:16]
Please stop.

[13:17]
[panting]

[13:19]
President Lohan! Get away from that fire hose!

[13:24]
[all] Fire hose!

[13:25]
[grunts] Sorry I'm late, guys!

[13:27]
Todd, we take tardiness seriously here at Shenanigags.

[13:30]
-If you miss one more class, you're out. -I'm sorry. But, wait, Bryan isn't here.

[13:35]
-He's later than I am. -Bryan's not gonna be at practice anymore.

[13:38]
He's been negative, so Copernicus thought he could benefit from some time away.

[13:42]
He's been reassigned to the Shenanigags comedy cruise line, the Giggleship.

[13:46]
-Is that a reward or a punishment? -That's up to Bryan.

[13:49]
Let's have no more questions about the Giggleship.

[13:52]
Oh, uh, all right.

[13:53]
Well, you know, I was actually talking to my best friend,

[13:56]
and he said improv is a cult.

[13:59]
I mean, that's crazy, right?

[14:02]
[all laughing]

[14:06]
[coughs]

[14:07]
If you think Shenanigags is a cult, you're free to go, Todd.

[14:10]
Oh, no. I don't wanna go. I love this place.

[14:12]
My friend just doesn't know how great you guys are.

[14:15]
It sounds like your friend's not yes-and'ing you.

[14:18]
Invite him to your graduation show.

[14:20]
If he's too negative to support you, you should take a good hard think

[14:24]
about if that's the kind of energy you want in your life.

[14:26]
[groans] I hate good hard thinks.

[14:33]
I love you, too, Mr. Peanutbutter. But I-- I gotta go.

[14:36]
I'm-- Yeah, I'm building a school for deaf kids.

[14:39]
The kids get jealous if I'm talking on the phone.

[14:42]
Uh, okay, bye.

[14:43]
So, hey, hi.

[14:44]
How long are you thinking of staying here? Just for my own reference.

[14:48]
Oh, shit. Is Wanda making you get rid of me?

[14:51]
No one is making me do anything.

[14:53]
Except keep acting in this movie you hate.

[14:55]
Well, yeah.

[14:56]
I really thought I could do it. I thought I could go far away and help people

[15:01]
and be this best possible version of myself.

[15:03]
And what happened?

[15:04]
I couldn't.

[15:06]
I wasn't the person I thought I was.

[15:09]
I'd love to stay and wallow with you, but I gotta head out.

[15:11]
Today we're filming what used to be the scene where Secretariat commits suicide,

[15:15]
but is now a scene where he swims in a fishing hole

[15:18]
-with his girlfriend "Susie Side." -Yeesh.

[15:21]
If you wanna blow off work, I'm probably just gonna sit on the couch,

[15:24]
drink beer, and watch old episodes of Horsin' Around.

[15:27]
Hmm.

[15:28]
[audience laughs]

[15:29]
And if I hear one more peep out of you--

[15:31]
-[crashing] -[audience laughs]

[15:33]
-Sabrina! -[Sabrina] What? I didn't peep!

[15:36]
Oh!

[15:39]
[audience applauding]

[15:40]
Sabrina was such a little bitch.

[15:42]
She was an orphan. She had a tough life.

[15:45]
Hey, Diane, you're still here. And BoJack is here.

[15:48]
Did you go to work today?

[15:50]
I was gonna, but then I remembered everything is garbage,

[15:52]
so why bother doing anything?

[15:54]
-True story. -Okay.

[15:56]
[the horse] Oh, you didn't.

[15:58]
[audience laughing]

[15:59]
Oh, you did.

[16:01]
[sitcom theme plays over TV]

[16:06]
-Hello. -Hey, could you get the door?

[16:09]
-Whoa. -Mm.

[16:10]
The property's gonna be ready in June. Gives us two months

[16:13]
to get everything we need out of this place.

[16:15]
Mm. Perfect.

[16:16]
Just so you know, I had to register the corporation in your name.

[16:19]
-What? -Just until the divorce is finalized.

[16:21]
Katie's lawyers are watching me closely right now.

[16:24]
They're hawks.

[16:25]
I mean, not literally. Well, one literally.

[16:27]
Know what, actually, he might be a falcon.

[16:29]
Rutabaga, this is too--

[16:30]
This is a temporary technicality, I promise.

[16:32]
I'm not gonna leave you holding the bag. Okay?

[16:35]
Mm. Mm.

[16:36]
Hey, your assistant wasn't out there, so I just-- Ooh.

[16:39]
-Oh, hello. -Look at this urn.

[16:41]
What's going on in here?

[16:42]
Mr. Peanutbutter, shut the door.

[16:44]
Rutabaga and I are starting a new agency, and we want you to come with us.

[16:50]
Well, well, well, what delicious irony.

[16:53]
It appears the cat is chasing the dog.

[16:56]
Are you in or out?

[16:57]
Are you kidding?

[16:58]
You're the agent who got me Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities.

[17:02]
-Well-- -What do they know?

[17:03]
-Right, so-- -Do they know things?

[17:04]
-Okay-- -Let's find out.

[17:06]
-Right-- -Big fan.

[17:07]
I like you guys.

[17:09]
I like your hustle and I like your matching lipstick.

[17:11]
-Well, um-- -I am in.

[17:13]
Mm-hm.

[17:17]
Go home, Goober.

[17:19]
Yeah! Go home, Goober!

[17:20]
[coughs] Goober sucks. Why doesn't he ever go home?

[17:23]
Yeah, Goober's the one who should go home.

[17:25]
-You suck, Goober! -Hey, Goober! Get murdered!

[17:27]
Go sit on a sharp dick, you piece of shit.

[17:31]
-Hey, guys. -Shut up, Todd.

[17:33]
BoJack, listen, I-- Oh!

[17:35]
-Hey, whoa! -Boo! Party foul!

[17:37]
-You knocked over Bucking-can Palace. -Come on!

[17:40]
Uh, sorry, I'll clean that up later.

[17:42]
Listen to this guy, "clean it up later." Hasn't picked up his shit in years.

[17:45]
Clean up your shit, Todd.

[17:47]
BoJack, I wanted to invite you to my graduation show tomorrow night.

[17:51]
-What? -Look, I know you think

[17:53]
it's just a dumb cult, but you're my best friend

[17:57]
and it would really mean a lot if you came.

[17:59]
[groans] I'm gonna go down to the basement to practice my space work.

[18:04]
And here I am going downstairs.

[18:09]
[cell phone ringing]

[18:10]
Hello?

[18:11]
-What kind of pants are you wearing now? -What? I don't know. The normal kind.

[18:15]
Yeah? Mm. Are they comfy? A comfy pair of pants?

[18:18]
I guess. Why?

[18:20]
Just wondering what kind of hit you're gonna take

[18:22]
when the studio sues the pants off you for breach of contract.

[18:26]
They're suing me? Also, are you wearing comfortable shoes?

[18:29]
Because that was a long road to walk to get to that punch line.

[18:31]
-This is serious. -We're not just doing bits?

[18:33]
You started it with the pants thing.

[18:35]
You need to go back to set. You can't just not go to work.

[18:39]
[sighs]

[18:40]
Remember, you wanted this.

[18:45]
Are you saying you're finally ready to settle down with yours truly?

[18:49]
Darn tootin'. I may be a professional racehorse,

[18:51]
but I'm tired of running in circles.

[18:53]
[Abe] Cut!

[18:54]
Perfect. But let's get that last part again.

[18:57]
-Anything you want me to do differently? -No, I just think we should get it again.

[19:02]
You know, for safety.

[19:04]
-Action! -I'm tired of running in circles.

[19:07]
[slurps] And again?

[19:08]
I'm tired of running in circles.

[19:10]
Why don't we get it like five more times?

[19:13]
I'm tired of running in circles.

[19:15]
I'm tired of running in circles.

[19:17]
I'm tired of running in circles.

[19:19]
I'm tired of running in circles.

[19:21]
I'm tired of running in circles.

[19:23]
[Abe] Let's get it ten more times.

[19:26]
[sighs]

[19:30]
-Ta-da! -We did it.

[19:32]
-What now? -We die, have our guts ripped out

[19:35]
through our noses, and get enshrined inside of it. Duh.

[19:38]
Hey, BoJack, can I talk to you for a minute?

[19:40]
Ooh...

[19:42]
Alone, please?

[19:43]
Oh...

[19:46]
So, good news. We're gonna go on a trip.

[19:49]
-Right now. You and me. -What?

[19:50]
I booked us a room for the weekend. Pack your bags, let's go.

[19:53]
Where? Why?

[19:54]
Less asking, more basking.

[19:56]
In the sun, that is. Santa Barbara.

[19:58]
-I'm not really in the mood for-- -I think some time away

[20:01]
could be really good for us, as a couple.

[20:03]
Oh.

[20:04]
I know you've been really bummed out about the movie,

[20:07]
but I don't think moping around the house with Diane all day is healthy.

[20:11]
All I've ever wanted was to be in this movie,

[20:13]
and you just want me to put on a happy face--

[20:15]
Yes. There are lots of people who don't like their jobs.

[20:18]
Doesn't mean they have to bring it home with--

[20:21]
-Yeah, that's easy for you to say. -What is that supposed to mean?

[20:24]
Well, come on. You're a network executive.

[20:27]
You don't give a shit about work.

[20:29]
I actually have a lot of pride in what I do.

[20:31]
What? You have a lot of pride?

[20:33]
Your job is to pump out garbage every year

[20:35]
hoping some of the garbage stinks less than the rest

[20:38]
so you can quietly renew that garbage and keep failing sideways

[20:41]
until you retire to a three-point-five bedroom garbage

[20:44]
in Beverly Garbage and spend the rest of your life

[20:46]
-watching your former assistant's garbage. -I don't know where this is coming from.

[20:50]
Every good thing that ever happened to you happened

[20:53]
because of network executives like me.

[20:55]
That show you spend all day watching, your house, your career--

[20:59]
Great house, great career, great life! Must be why I'm so happy all the time!

[21:02]
-You don't know-- -I don't?

[21:04]
My life was ruined by a network executive like you.

[21:08]
Well, I'm sorry that things have been so hard for you,

[21:12]
but that doesn't give you the right to be shitty to me. I can't be around someone

[21:15]
who's just fueled by bitterness and negativity.

[21:19]
Well then, what are you doing here?

[21:22]
What happened, BoJack?

[21:24]
Same thing that always happens.

[21:26]
You didn't know me. Then you fell in love with me.

[21:30]
And now you know me.

[21:33]
You know, it's funny. When you look at someone through rose-colored glasses,

[21:38]
all the red flags just look like flags.

[21:46]
-So, Wanda's moving out. -Oh, shit. Because of me?

[21:50]
No. Because of me.

[21:51]
I'm sorry. You wanna watch another episode of Horsin' Around?

[21:55]
Where Olivia does the school project where she pretends an egg is a baby.

[21:58]
Spoiler alert: Ethan needs to make an omelet.

[22:02]
Why won't you go home?

[22:04]
I should. I know I should.

[22:07]
I wish I could just go home right now and crawl into bed

[22:09]
and not have to talk about anything or explain anything.

[22:13]
He would just say, "How was your day?" And then he would say,

[22:16]
"Hey, did you know the monorail was invented by George Monorail?"

[22:19]
And I would say, "I don't think that's true."

[22:21]
And he would say, "Well, if he didn't invent it, he certainly perfected it."

[22:25]
And I wouldn't have to say, "I'm sorry I left.

[22:28]
I'm sorry I made things so difficult.

[22:30]
I'm sorry I'm not the person I thought I was."

[22:34]
I would just say, "My day was good."

[22:37]
And he would say, "I love you."

[22:41]
The longer you keep lying to him, the harder it's gonna get.

[22:44]
Can I ask you something?

[22:46]
That play in New York, would that really have made you happy?

[22:50]
Yeah. I mean, for a little bit.

[22:53]
And if Kelsey didn't get fired,

[22:54]
and you got to make the movie you wanted to make,

[22:57]
would that have made you happy?

[22:58]
For a little bit.

[23:00]
But then...

[23:02]
Probably...

[23:04]
So, what does it matter?

[23:06]
But there has to be more.

[23:09]
Well, when's the last time you were actually happy?

[23:24]
You microchipped my penis? Check, please!

[23:28]
[all] Microchip.

[23:29]
[laughs]

[23:31]
Ah.

[23:32]
[audience applauding]

[23:35]
[sighs]

[23:40]
[doorbell rings]

[23:43]
Oh.

[23:48]
[all] Todd!

[23:49]
-[Todd groans] -[all laughing]

[23:51]
[laughs] Yeah.

[23:57]
Oh.

[23:58]
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

[24:00]
Hey. How are you?

[24:02]
I can't do this anymore.

[24:04]
You can't do what anymore?

[24:06]
I can't talk to you on the phone all the time.

[24:09]
It's too hard.

[24:10]
Uh, have you tried Bluetooth?

[24:12]
I think maybe we should stop calling each other, for a little bit.

[24:15]
I'm sorry. I just miss you too much.

[24:19]
But listen, I love you. Okay?

[24:22]
Mr. Peanutbutter?

[24:23]
Uh, yeah. Uh, okay.

[24:26]
I love you, Diane.

[24:29]
-Where is he? -I don't know, sir.

[24:30]
Can't do this to me. Where the hell is he?
