VIRGIL: ...and then we'll be fully financed!

[17:41]
CAROLYN: Todd can do it! Todd can do anything! Can I get your autograph?

[17:44]
TODD: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[17:45]
CAROLYN: And another autograph, and initial here, here, here, and here.

[17:48]
TODD: Right here?

[17:49]
CAROLYN: And the last four digits of your social.

[17:50]
TODD: Okay.

[17:51]
TODD: So I think the big third act number Virgil wants might be a big anthem that--

[17:56]
BOJACK: Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy, buddy, I'm not gonna let you start on this until we stock up on snacks and Red Bull.

[18:02]
TODD: I do get snacky. You think of everything.

[18:09]
MARGO: 'Scuse me, young man. Can you hand me that Ronnie Milsap cassingle in the 10-cent bin?

[18:14]
TODD: Sure thing, lady. Oh, my God. Decapathon VII? This just came out.

[18:23]
BOJACK: Todd, put it down.

[18:24]
TODD: Is this really only a dime?

[18:26]
IGUANA CLERK: If it's in there, that's the price.

[18:28]
BOJACK: Todd, this is no time for a relapse.

[18:31]
TODD: Look, okay, I'll buy it now, but I won't play it till after I've written the new song.

[18:35]
BOJACK: Todd, this is a bad idea!

[18:38]
TODD: Whoa!

[18:39]
IGUANA CLERK: All sales are final.

[18:42]
TODD: Okay, let's see here. I wonder if it still smells the same.

[18:47]
BOJACK: I assure you, it still smells like cheap plastic and child labor.

[18:50]
TODD: [sighs] Okay, here we go. Song time. [plays a single scale] Or should I just play one game now, just to get the creative juices flowing?

[18:59]
BOJACK: We both know that if you play that game tonight, you'll never leave this couch!

[19:02]
TODD: Ah, no, you're right, of course. Thank you.

[19:05]
BOJACK: Good night.

[19:07]
[three single piano notes]

[19:08]
[TEN SECONDS LATER]

[19:09]
[heavy metal music]

[19:11]
TODD: Come on, Decapathon, come on. [mumbling] Oh, come on, Decapathon. Oh. [grunts]

[19:18]
ROOSTER JOGGER: Wake up! It's the morning!

[19:21]
BOJACK: Damn it, Todd, the investor showcase is in half an hour. Did you work on the song?

[19:26]
TODD: Huh?

[19:27]
BOJACK: Pull yourself together, man!

[19:29]
TODD: Ugh! Why did the water have to come out of your mouth?

[19:33]
VIRGIL: Well, I'm awfully sorry to have wasted your time. I don't think our man is going to show.

[19:39]
[door slams open]

[19:40]
BOJACK: Wait!

[19:42]
VIRGIL: Good God, what's happened?

[19:43]
TODD: [groaning]

[19:44]
He looks like he was up all night playing some sort of videographic game. He's in no condition to debut a song.

[19:50]
BOJACK: Give the kid a chance, Van Cleef.

[19:52]
TODD: [groaning] [playing piano intro]
♪ Loam, loam, loam ♪
♪ And a-- uh, little room to, uh, roam ♪
♪ And on this planet It's our home ♪
♪ In space ♪

[20:13]
INVESTOR: Rock opera? More like "schlock flop-era."

[20:16]
TODD: [slams keys] Ugh! ♪ Loam ♪

[20:20]
VIRGIL: Enough! Clearly, Van Cleef has shown a rare lapse in taste and judgment. I apologize for wasting your time with this talentless imp.

[20:29]
BOJACK: Hey, Van Cleef, Todd may not be ready for the high-flying world of rock opera or the larger world outside of my living room couch, but you know what? He's a good friend.

[20:40]
VIRGIL: I don't see how that's relevant.

[20:41]
BOJACK: No, of course you don't. Maybe Todd's worse off today, but you're worse off in the long run, because you're gonna die alone and unloved, you pompous, affected asshole!

[20:50]
VIRGIL: [grunts] Mon dieu! Never have I ever!

[20:53]
TODD: Hey, maybe don't burn the bridge. I could still beg for a second chance.

[20:58]
BOJACK: Shut your mouth, Todd. And you shut yours, Van Cleef, or I will buck it shut. Suck a dick, dumb shits! [blows raspberry]

[21:08]
BOJACK: Oh, that damn video game.

[21:10]
TODD: No, it's not the video game's fault. I blew it. For a second, I actually convinced myself I was more than just a worthless screw-up. Fool me once, fool me twice, fool me chicken soup with rice.

[21:23]
BOJACK: I guess there's a reason they don't call it "the rock opera fun." They call it "the rock opera business."

[21:29]
TODD: [sighs] Guess I won't be needing this piece of junk anymore.

[21:32]
BOJACK: Hey, no. Hold on to that. Why don't you just put it in the living room closet?

[21:36]
TODD: Really?

[21:37]
BOJACK: In fact, from now on, you can keep all your stuff in the living room closet.

[21:40]
TODD: Thanks, BoJack, for everything.

[21:43]
BOJACK: This, I will get rid of.

[21:49]
DIANE: What the--

[21:50]
WAYNE: Don't look at those! Those are private!

[21:52]
DIANE: Are these the notes you've been taking on Mr. Peanutbutter? It's gibberish! Have you just been mashing keys this whole time?

[21:58]
WAYNE: It's a-- it's a work in progress.

[22:00]
DIANE: What's really going on here?

[22:02]
WAYNE: Look, I've been following you two around for the last couple weeks, and I think it's pretty obvious to everyone that you shouldn't be with Mr. Peanutbutter. You should be with me.

[22:11]
DIANE: No, I've dated you. Sure, you're smart and sophisticated and cool, but you're also mean. What's your article on Mr. Peanutbutter called?

[22:21]
WAYNE: The working title is, "Nine Jokes From the '90s We Haven't Stopped Laughing at."

[22:25]
DIANE: I knew it!

[22:26]
WAYNE: Come on! Like you're not gonna tear BoJack apart in your book.

[22:29]
DIANE: I'm not "tearing him apart." I'm writing a nuanced portrait of a complicated man.

[22:35]
WAYNE: Well, then, we might be doing different things.

[22:37]
DIANE: Mr. Peanutbutter is nice to me! He's kind and he's generous and he's loyal.

[22:43]
WAYNE: You know what your problem is? You're trying to be a Zelda but you're so obviously a Zoe.

[22:49]
DIANE: Ugh! Don't label me. You don't know who I am.

[22:51]
WAYNE: You can live your happy Zelda life in this happy Zelda town and pretend you're a happy Zelda, but I know you, and this isn't you. People don't change, Diane, not really. Mr. Peanutbutter's a Zelda. He's happy and he's carefree and he's loving, but you and me, we're Zoes.

[23:10]
BOJACK: Yeah, I bought this earlier, and I'd like to return it. I don't know where the receipt went.

[23:15]
HIPPO CLERK: I remember you. You came in yesterday. No problem.

[23:20]
WAYNE: We're Zoes, Diane. We're cynical and we're sad and we're mean.

[23:25]
BOJACK: Thanks for your help, character actress Margo Martindale.

[23:29]
MARGO: I don't feel good about what we did here, BoJack.

[23:32]
BOJACK: I don't know what you're talking about. This never happened.

[23:36]
WAYNE: There's a darkness inside you, and you can bury it deep in burritos as big as your head, but someday soon, that darkness is gonna come out, and when it does, I want you to call me.

[23:51]
MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I like that guy.

[23:54]
TODD: [straining] Ahh. [whistles]
