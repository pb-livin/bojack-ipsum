[07:06]
Five years ago, he found his way into one of my house parties

[07:08]
and never left.

[07:10]
And you've never asked him anything about himself?

[07:12]
I've asked him to get a job, I've asked him to move out.

[07:14]
With a little encouragement,

[07:15]
I'll bet he could really flourish.

[07:17]
I mean, didn't you have anyone who helped you

[07:18]
when you were just starting out?

[07:20]
Um, actually, no.

[07:21]
Todd clearly thinks the world of you.

[07:23]
Todd thinks the world of Pop-Tarts.

[07:25]
Look, I get that helping other people is not your thing, but--

[07:28]
What? I let Todd live rent-free in my stately manse.

[07:30]
I am his own personal Mother Teresa.

I-I don't understand. Oh, my God, are you dying?

[08:02]
No. I... think you have great depth of untapped potential

and I wish to mentor you in your... art.

[08:09]
- Really? - Yes.

Wait, is this going to be like that time

[08:13]
you promised to take me ice skating,

[08:15]
and I got really excited about the ice skating,

[12:38]

[12:42]
I was up for Dr. Decapitator in the movie version.

Whoo! [applause]

[15:41]
You know, I run a small theater in North Hollywood.

[15:43]
We were supposed to mount a J.C. Superstar revival

[15:46]
next month, but of course, Andrew Lloyd Webber has to be

[15:49]
a real hot penis about everything.

[15:51]
Oh, Andy. Fool me once, shame on you,

[15:54]
but teach a man to fool me,

[15:55]
and I'll be fooled for the rest of my life.

[15:58]
Anyway, could this show be ready to debut in six weeks?

[16:01]
Six weeks? Uh, damn. Yeah, I guess so.

[16:04]
Marvelous! We'll schedule an investor showcase posthaste.

[16:08]
In the meantime, libations!

[16:10]
Ah! [laughter]

[16:13]
- Popping, what? - This is great.

[16:14]
You know, just when you think you have a person pegged,

[16:16]
he can still find ways to surprise you.

[16:19]
Yeah, Todd really rose to the occasion, didn't he?

[16:21]
I was talking about you.

[16:22]
Ah, well, it was nothing.

[16:24]
Maybe the Zoe has a little Zelda in him after all.

[16:27]
I appreciate the sentiment,

[16:28]
but I still think that game is stupid.

[16:30]
Hey, BoJack, do you realize what this means?

[16:32]
I mean, if this thing's a hit, I could finally move out.

[16:35]
Oh, uh, you're gonna move out?

[16:37]
You won't have to yell, "Hey, Todd, clean up your shit!"

[16:40]
Or, "Todd, why haven't you cleaned up your shit yet?"

[16:43]
Or, "Todd, what was the name of that guy from Perfect Strangers?

[16:46]
Not Bronson Pinchot, but the other one?"

[16:48]
Good, that's great. That's great and good.

[16:51]
So good, so great.

[16:54]
- Just great, and also good. - Mm-hmm.

[17:03]
And as you can see, progress has been swift.

[17:05]
For tomorrow's investor showcase,

[17:07]
we'll have choreography and pyrotechnics for you.

[17:10]
This is all just happening so fast.

[17:12]
I don't-- I don't think Todd is ready for this.

[17:14]
Todd's not ready or you're not ready?

[17:16]
Don't make this about me. I've seen what happens

[17:19]
when baby birds get pushed out of the nest too soon.

[17:21]
It's not your fault.

[17:24]
I thought he was ready. He seemed ready.

[17:26]
It's not... your... fault.

[17:30]
You're right. In these heady times,

[17:32]
what Todd needs is an agent. Ha! Ha!

[17:35]
- I just need you to deliver... - Hoo! Ha!

[17:37]
- That third act showstopper... - Ha!

[17:39]
...and then we'll be fully financed!

[17:41]
Todd can do it! Todd can do anything!

[17:44]
- Can I get your autograph? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[17:45]
And another autograph,

[17:47]
and initial here, here, here, and here.

[17:48]
- Right here? - And the last four digits

[17:50]
- of your social. - Okay.

[17:51]
So I think the big third act number Virgil wants

[17:55]
might be a big anthem that--

[17:56]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy, buddy,

[17:58]
I'm not gonna let you start on this until we stock up

[18:00]
on snacks and Red Bull.

[18:02]
I do get snacky. You think of everything.

[18:09]
'Scuse me, young man.

[18:10]
Can you hand me that Ronnie Milsap cassingle

[18:13]
in the 10-cent bin?

[18:14]
Sure thing, lady.

[18:17]
Oh, my God. Decapathon VII?

[18:21]
This just came out.

[18:23]
Todd, put it down.

[18:24]
Is this really only a dime?

[18:26]
If it's in there, that's the price.

[18:28]
Todd, this is no time for a relapse.

[18:31]
Look, okay, I'll buy it now, but I won't play it

[18:33]
till after I've written the new song.

[18:35]
Todd, this is a bad idea!

[18:38]
- Whoa! - All sales are final.

[18:42]
Okay, let's see here.

[18:45]
I wonder if it still smells the same.

[18:47]
I assure you, it still smells

[18:48]
like cheap plastic and child labor.

[18:50]
[sighs] Okay, here we go. Song time.

[18:53]
[plays a single scale]

[18:55]
Or should I just play one game now,

[18:56]
just to get the creative juices flowing?

[18:59]
We both know that if you play that game tonight,

[19:01]
you'll never leave this couch!

[19:02]
Ah, no, you're right, of course.

[19:04]
- Thank you. - Good night.

[19:08]

[19:13]
[mumbling] Oh, come on, Decapathon.

[19:16]
Oh. [grunts]

[19:18]
Wake up! It's the morning!

[19:21]
Damn it, Todd, the investor showcase is in half an hour.

[19:25]
- Did you work on the song? - Huh?

[19:27]
Pull yourself together, man!

[19:29]
Ugh! Why did the water have to come out of your mouth?

[19:33]
Well, I'm awfully sorry to have wasted your time.

[19:36]
I don't think our man is going to show.

[19:43]
He looks like he was up all night

[19:45]
playing some sort of videographic game.

[19:48]
He's in no condition to debut a song.

[20:25]
I apologize for wasting your time with this talentless imp.

[20:29]
Hey, Van Cleef, Todd may not be ready

[20:32]
for the high-flying world of rock opera

[20:34]
or the larger world outside of my living room couch,

[20:37]
but you know what? He's a good friend.

[20:40]
I don't see how that's relevant.

[20:41]
No, of course you don't. Maybe Todd's worse off today,

[20:44]
but you're worse off in the long run,

[20:46]
because you're gonna die alone and unloved,

[20:48]
you pompous, affected asshole!

Hey, maybe don't burn the bridge.

I could still beg for a second chance.

[20:58]
Shut your mouth, Todd.

[20:59]
And you shut yours, Van Cleef, or I will buck it shut.

[21:02]
Suck a dick, dumb shits! [blows raspberry]

[21:08]
Oh, that damn video game.

[21:10]
No, it's not the video game's fault.

[21:12]
I blew it.

[21:14]
For a second, I actually convinced myself

[21:16]
I was more than just a worthless screw-up.

[21:19]
Fool me once, fool me twice, fool me chicken soup with rice.

[21:23]
I guess there's a reason they don't call it

[21:25]
"the rock opera fun."

[21:26]
They call it "the rock opera business."

[21:29]
[sighs] Guess I won't be needing

[21:30]
this piece of junk anymore.

[21:32]
Hey, no. Hold on to that.

[21:34]
Why don't you just put it in the living room closet?

[21:36]
- Really? - In fact, from now on,

[21:38]
you can keep all your stuff in the living room closet.

[21:40]
Thanks, BoJack, for everything.

[21:43]
This, I will get rid of.

[21:49]
- What the-- - Don't look at those!

[21:51]
- Those are private! - Are these the notes

[21:53]
you've been taking on Mr. Peanutbutter?

[21:54]
It's gibberish!

[21:56]
Have you just been mashing keys this whole time?

[21:58]
It's a-- it's a work in progress.

[22:00]
What's really going on here?

[22:02]
Look, I've been following you two around

[22:04]
for the last couple weeks, and I think it's pretty obvious

[22:07]
to everyone that you shouldn't be with Mr. Peanutbutter.

[22:09]
You should be with me.

[22:11]
No, I've dated you.

[22:13]
Sure, you're smart and sophisticated and cool,

[22:17]
but you're also mean.

[22:18]
What's your article on Mr. Peanutbutter called?

[22:21]
The working title is, "Nine Jokes From the '90s

[22:23]
We Haven't Stopped Laughing at."

[22:25]
- I knew it! - Come on!

[22:26]
Like you're not gonna tear BoJack apart in your book.

[22:29]
I'm not "tearing him apart."

[22:31]
I'm writing a nuanced portrait of a complicated man.

[22:35]
Well, then, we might be doing different things.

[22:37]
Mr. Peanutbutter is nice to me!

[22:40]
He's kind and he's generous and he's loyal.

[22:43]
You know what your problem is? You're trying to be a Zelda

[22:46]
but you're so obviously a Zoe.

[22:49]
Ugh! Don't label me. You don't know who I am.

[22:51]
You can live your happy Zelda life in this happy Zelda town

[22:55]
and pretend you're a happy Zelda,

[22:57]
but I know you, and this isn't you.

[23:01]
People don't change, Diane, not really.

[23:03]
Mr. Peanutbutter's a Zelda.

[23:05]
He's happy and he's carefree

[23:07]
and he's loving, but you and me, we're Zoes.

[23:10]
Yeah, I bought this earlier, and I'd like to return it.

[23:14]
I don't know where the receipt went.

[23:15]
I remember you. You came in yesterday.

[23:18]
No problem.

[23:20]
[Wayne] We're Zoes, Diane.

[23:22]
We're cynical and we're sad and we're mean.

[23:25]
Thanks for your help, character actress

[23:27]
Margo Martindale.

[23:29]
I don't feel good about what we did here, BoJack.

[23:32]
I don't know what you're talking about.

[23:34]
This never happened.

[23:36]
[Wayne] There's a darkness inside you,

[23:39]
and you can bury it deep in burritos as big as your head,

[23:43]
but someday soon, that darkness is gonna come out,

[23:46]
and when it does, I want you to call me.
