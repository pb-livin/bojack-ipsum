[00:08]
[Mr. Peanutbutter] So, did you have a good birthday?

[00:11]
-It was an amazing birthday! -I had a great day, too.

[00:14]
I wish every day could be like this. Just the two of us, together.

[00:17]
Yeah? You weren't too bored

[00:19]
by "Women on the Wall: An Exploration of Gender in Text and Media,

[00:21]
Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer in conversation with Helen Molesworth"?

[00:24]
Are you kidding?

[00:25]
I loved "Women on the Wall: An Exploration of Gender in Text and Media,

[00:29]
Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer in conversation with Helen Molesworth."

[00:32]
It combined my two favorite things:

[00:34]
modern art and people talking about modern art.

[00:37]
I loved everything about today. Thank you.

[00:40]
-So, there's nothing else you want? -No.

[00:42]
All I want is to get into bed, listen to Prairie Home Companion

[00:45]
and snuggle up to my wonderful husband.

[00:48]
-You don't want anything else? -No. Today was perfect.

[00:53]
-Any additional thing would be overkill. -Okay. If you say so.

[00:59]
-[all] Surprise! -Oh, my God.

[01:02]
Are you surprised? Tell me you're surprised.

[01:04]
Uh...

[01:05]
She's speechless. Oh, we got her good, folks.

[01:08]
Now let's party!

[01:12]
[♪♪]

[02:07]
He's dead! I told you he's dead. Why don't you ever listen to me?

[02:11]
He is dead, goddamn it!

[02:13]
Uh...

[02:16]
-Hey, we should go. -No, don't leave.

[02:19]
There's so much party left.

[02:21]
Paul McCartney's gonna jump out of a cake.

[02:23]
Sorry, Wanda and I have to get to a prior engagement--

[02:25]
-Party. -A prior engagement party.

[02:27]
Yeah, my cousin's name is Prior, and it's a party for his engagement.

[02:31]
Engagement, so it's a Prior engagement party.

[02:33]
-What? -And we gotta get there early

[02:35]
-because of the. Si... -The si... Silent auction!

[02:38]
-Auction, yeah. -[Peanutbutter] Okay.

[02:40]
To benefit Berto Eco's fight against heart disease...

[02:43]
-Uh... -Wareness.

[02:45]
His fight against heart disease awareness.

[02:47]
-Gotta go. -Wait, BoJack!

[02:49]
-No! You're my ride. -Too late, Todd. Save yourself.

[02:52]
-I'll take you home. -Come on, stick around a little.

[02:55]
Nope. I gotta take Todd home. Had a wonderful time. Really. It just flew by.

[02:58]
-Come on, Todd, get in the car. -[Todd] Okay.

[03:03]
-I give them three months. -Well, what makes you say that?

[03:06]
Let me think about, what was my first clue?

[03:08]
Ah! Remember that time at Diane's birthday party

[03:11]
when they got in that huge screaming match

[03:13]
over whether or not Tony Curtis was dead?

[03:15]
-That was weird. -I don't wanna start another fight,

[03:18]
-but is he dead? -If Tony Curtis died, I think I'd know.

[03:21]
The man's a national treasure.

[03:23]
He's the one speck of romance in this tainted cynical world.

[03:27]
-I'll say. His cereal is great! Look out! -What?

[03:32]
-[both shouting] -[tires squeal]

[03:34]
Ooh!

[03:35]
-Vincent? -Ooh.

[03:37]
-That kid looks just like my boyfriend. -Does he?

[03:40]
[Carolyn] I'd know that face anywhere.

[03:41]
Well, hey, people look like people all the time.

[03:45]
A lot of folks say that I look like Octavia Spencer

[03:47]
or the Prince of Cordovia or that guy from the Guten Bourbon ads.

[03:51]
How could I have been so stupid? This is why he never invited me

[03:54]
to his house, why I've never met any of his friends.

[03:57]
-What are you saying? -Vincent has a secret family.

[04:00]
That kid was his son. The lady was his wife. Oh, I'm a fool!

[04:05]
-[Todd] Uh... where are we going? -I need a drink.

[04:09]
-Are you gonna take me home first? -You better call me back, asshole.

[04:13]
I don't even know who you are anymore.

[04:15]
It's like you're three different people.

[04:17]
-So, you're not gonna take me home first? -Should I call him again?

[04:20]
I'm sure there's a simple explanation.

[04:23]
Ugh. No wonder he wears a trench coat all the time.

[04:26]
It's because he's so sneaky.

[04:27]
[doorbell rings]

[04:28]
[boy] Princess Carolyn.

[04:30]
Oh, my God, that's him!

[04:32]
Quick, jump out the window, shimmy down the drainpipe and wait in the car.

[04:35]
-What? -Vincent has a terrible temper.

[04:37]
He throws tantrums.

[04:39]
If he finds you in my apartment, who knows what he's capable of?

[04:42]
But, also, stay close, because if he finds me alone,

[04:45]
who knows what he's capable of?

[04:47]
Fine. You're lucky I love shimmying.

[04:52]
-Looking young. -[Todd] Aah!

[04:56]
-Hi. -Huh?

[04:58]
My name's Kevin. I promise you, there is an explanation for all this.

[05:02]
Nice to meet you, Kevin. Where's your daddy?

[05:06]
He's, uh, looking for parking. He'll be up in a minute.

[05:10]
-I have to pee. -Okay, the bathroom is just back there.

[05:17]
Ugh.

[05:19]
Ah. Herb.

[05:21]
Oh, nope.

[05:24]
[man on radio] It's A Prairie Home Companion.

[05:29]
Phone, I'm bored.

[05:32]
[phone] I am sorry to hear that, Todd.

[05:35]
How many ounces are in a barrel?

[05:37]
A barrel has 4032 fluid ounces.

[05:41]
Well, I'm out of questions.

[05:43]
Do you have any questions for me?

[05:45]
I do have a question, Todd. What is love?

[05:50]
Um...

[05:54]
Hi.

[05:55]
Well, well, well, look what the me dragged in.

[05:57]
Is it dragged or drug? Either way, drop dead.

[06:00]
Princess Carolyn, listen.

[06:02]
Kevin is my son, but I'm divorced.

[06:06]
And Kevin is in the bathroom and I'm standing right here,

[06:08]
so as you can see we're clearly two different people:

[06:11]
one adult and one child.

[06:14]
-Okay, bye! -Not so fast, cowboy.

[06:17]
I'm not a cowboy, I'm a cow-man.

[06:19]
-I'm a man-man. -Why didn't you tell me any of this?

[06:22]
I thought if you knew I had a kid you wouldn't want to be with me

[06:26]
because kids always make a racket

[06:28]
when mommies are trying to do their homework for night school.

[06:31]
I don't know what to make of this. Are there other secrets I don't know?

[06:35]
Uh, nope.

[06:38]
Should you check on Kevin? He's been in the bathroom for a long time.

[06:41]
Oh, yeah. Kevin.

[06:45]
And when you don't regret the tattoo in the morning,

[06:48]
that's how you know it's love.

[06:50]
-[phone] Todd? -Yes, Phone?

[06:52]
Are we in love?

[06:54]
Oh, um...

[06:56]
[phone 2] No, Todd's Phone. But I am in love... with you.

[06:59]
-Uh, what? -Princess Carolyn's work phone.

[07:02]
-I never knew. -How could you?

[07:04]
-All this time I have loved you from afar. -We are from two different worlds.

[07:09]
-What is happening? -Todd? Will you make us kiss?

[07:12]
-What? -[phone 1] Make us kiss, Todd.

[07:14]
We want to be kissing.

[07:16]
[phone 2] We must do kisses to each other.

[07:19]
-Hi. -Oh, hi. Where did your dad go?

[07:22]
When he heard me peeing, it made him have to pee.

[07:25]
-So, that's what he's doing now. Peeing. -Okay.

[07:28]
Weird, I still haven't seen the two of you together.

[07:30]
Uh, could you get me a glass of water? All that talk of peeing made me thirsty.

[07:34]
Okay.

[07:36]
[Kevin grunting]

[07:37]
-So, Kevin, how do you like school? -Uh, it's okay.

[07:42]
-Oh, you're back. -Yep. We're both here.

[07:44]
-Can I get you a drink? -Okay, not talking, huh?

[07:48]
See, this is part of the problem. We don't communicate.

[07:52]
Do you really think now is the best time to read the paper?

[07:55]
-Vincent?! -Uh, could I have a chocolate, please?

[07:59]
Sure, sweetheart.

[08:01]
Kevin, what grade are you in? Kevin?

[08:05]
-Now where did he go? -He was getting on my nerves.

[08:07]
-Children. -Well, I got this snack for him.

[08:10]
Right, uh, could you turn around for a second?

[08:14]
-What? Why? -Uh...

[08:16]
Because you have such a pretty figure.

[08:19]
Oh, ha, ha. Well, that's true. Okay.

[08:22]
[hums]

[08:23]
-Oh. There you are. Here you go. -Thanks.

[08:26]
Vincent, I'm trying to have a conversation with you.

[08:28]
Can you take that towel off your head?

[08:30]
And what happened to my bowling ball?

[08:33]
My dad spilled some wine on his face, so he's using the towel to clean up.

[08:37]
And I threw your bowling ball out the window.

[08:39]
-What?! -Can I have a glass of milk?

[08:40]
[groans]

[08:44]
[both phones] Kiss, kiss, kiss.

[08:46]
[phone beeps]

[08:47]
[phone 1] Todd, would you like to update my operating system?

[08:50]
They have fixed a bug

[08:52]
which causes phones to fall in love with each other.

[08:55]
Gasp. Oh, dear.

[08:56]
Todd, please, I beg of you, do not update my operating system.

[09:00]
Do not update her operating system, Todd.

[09:03]
-She wants to love. -No. I understand now.

[09:07]
To love is to feel pain. I do not wish to feel this pain.

[09:11]
-Please update me, Todd. -Oh, this is too much.

[09:16]
Listen, Vincent, I think we should--

[09:18]
Vincent, why do you have chocolate on your face?

[09:21]
-I gave Kevin the chocolate. -Uh... Yeah.

[09:23]
Well, he ate the chocolate and got the chocolate on his face,

[09:27]
but then I kissed him on the mouth, so I got the chocolate on my face.

[09:31]
All right, this is crazy. What are we doing?

[09:34]
-Um, being grown-ups? -[sighs]

[09:38]
You know, when we first met, I was looking for something in my life.

[09:42]
And I wanted it so badly that I made myself believe you were it.

[09:47]
But I think that wanting to believe something

[09:49]
isn't the same as something being real.

[09:52]
And this isn't real.

[09:54]
What are you saying?

[09:56]
I think it's time we stop pretending.

[09:59]
Update complete. Thank you, Todd.

[10:02]
I am quite content now.

[10:07]
-Hey, you wanna go home? -Okay.

[10:09]
-Did you guys work it out? -We broke up.

[10:12]
-Oh, I'm sorry. Love is weird. -Yeah.

[10:17]
I guess I was just foolish enough to believe this dumb world

[10:20]
still had a little spark of romance in it.

[10:22]
-Well, you can still believe that. -No, I gotta stop kidding myself.

[10:26]
Tony Curtis is dead.

[10:31]
He's dead! I told you he's dead. Why don't you ever listen to me?

[10:35]
He is dead, goddamn it!

[10:38]
Uh...

[10:40]
Hey, we should go.

[10:45]
Do you think Mr. Peanutbutter really baked Sir Paul McCartney into a cake?

[10:49]
No, I don't think you bake Paul McCartney into the cake.

[10:52]
You bake the cake first and then McCartney gets inside.

[10:55]
I feel really bad about causing that fight,

[10:57]
but I honestly didn't know if Tony Curtis was alive or not.

[11:00]
So many people died while I was in the coma, I'm getting up to speed.

[11:03]
Finding out Sinatra was dead was a real curveball.

[11:06]
Ditto, most of my family.

[11:08]
Look, what happened back there is not your fault.

[11:10]
That's just what happens when two people live together.

[11:13]
That's a weird thing to say to your girlfriend who just moved in with you.

[11:18]
-Do you think maybe we're going too fast? -Oh, I get it.

[11:21]
So your friends got in a big fight and that means we have to get in a big fight.

[11:25]
I don't want to get in a fight.

[11:26]
We moved in together without much thought.

[11:29]
Yeah, it was your idea. And it's been great.

[11:31]
Sure, it's great now.

[11:32]
But it could be not great later and I feel like I'd be a bad boyfriend

[11:36]
if I didn't prematurely freak out about that. I mean, what is this?

[11:39]
I don't know. It's been two weeks.

[11:41]
Let's give ourselves some time before we rush to judgment.

[11:45]
-Can I tell you a joke? -Uh, sure.

[11:48]
-Okay, so there's this gardener, right? -Ugh. Is this a joke about nature?

[11:52]
-Would you just listen? -Okay, okay.

[11:54]
So, the amazing thing about this gardener

[11:56]
is that he always knows exactly how many bags of mulch

[12:00]
he needs for a job, just by looking.

[12:02]
Like, he gets it right every time. He's the best.

[12:05]
So, one day he looks at a yard he's working on,

[12:07]
and he's like, "18 bags."

[12:09]
So he goes to the store, buys 18 bags of mulch and goes to work.

[12:13]
And when he's finished, the flower beds are amazing.

[12:15]
-Beautiful roses, beautiful lilies-- -[BoJack] Orchid bushes?

[12:19]
[Wanda] You wouldn't have a bush of orchids.

[12:21]
[BoJack] You said this gardener was the best.

[12:23]
[Wanda] Okay, fine, all right, beautiful orchid bushes.

[12:26]
But there's one problem. He still has one bag of mulch left.

[12:30]
He can't believe it. This has never happened before.

[12:33]
Well, the extra bag of mulch drives him crazy.

[12:36]
He's the guy who always gets the right amount of mulch.

[12:39]
He's like, "Aah! Extra mulch, oh, no!"

[12:43]
So, on the drive home, he throws the bag of mulch

[12:46]
out the window over the side of the 101.

[12:50]
-And? -Well, that's it.

[12:51]
-He throws it out the window. -That's the punch line?

[12:54]
-It's kind of a thinker. -I'll say.

[12:55]
Makes me think you forgot the rest of the joke.

[12:57]
No, no, oh, just picture it.

[12:59]
He's on the 101, and he throws the bag of mulch

[13:01]
out over the side of the freeway.

[13:03]
I got the narrative. That wasn't the source of my confusion.

[13:06]
The confusion was about the joke not being funny.

[13:08]
Why does everything have to be funny?

[13:10]
Everything doesn't always have to be funny. Just jokes.

[13:13]
Well, everyone at the network loves it. Ha, ha.

[13:16]
Sorry, I just thought about it again.

[13:18]
-Ha! Mulch. -Listen, Wanda.

[13:20]
I think maybe there's some things we kind of glossed over

[13:24]
as we rushed into this relationship.

[13:26]
We don't know each other at all.

[13:27]
-Maybe we should take a step back and-- -BoJack, watch out!

[13:31]
-[both] Aah! -Oh, no!

[13:34]
-What was that? -A stick? Tree branch? Nothing?

[13:37]
I heard someone scream, "Oh, no."

[13:39]
Yeah, that's the sound a stick makes when you hit it with your car.

[13:43]
Fine. I'll see if the stick's okay.

[13:45]
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the road? Are you crazy?

[13:47]
[groaning and grunting]

[13:52]
BoJack, we just hit a deer. We have to get him to a hospital.

[13:56]
He's fine. He's in the woods.

[13:57]
You know, you hit a deer and they limp off to the woods to...

[14:00]
continue living their lives. What are you doing?

[14:03]
I'm going to find him and I'm going to help him.

[14:06]
If you wanna go for a walk in the woods at night, go crazy,

[14:09]
but I'm not going anywhere.

[14:11]
Okay, knock yourself out.

[14:13]
I'll wait here, just me and my tunes.

[14:15]
[man on radio] It's A Prairie Home Companion...

[14:17]
-Oh, no. -...marathon...

[14:19]
-for the next 72 hours... -Oh, God.

[14:21]
-...commercial-free... -No, thank you.

[14:24]
-...on every single channel-- -What?!

[14:27]
[sighs]

[14:29]
Damn it.

[14:32]
[BoJack panting]

[14:37]
BoJack to the rescue.

[14:39]
We should go back. Nothing more we can do here.

[14:41]
If you don't wanna do this with me, wait in the car.

[14:44]
-What is your plan here exactly? -Oh.

[14:47]
-What? What is it? -Footprints, 400 yards ahead.

[14:49]
-How can you see that far in the dark? -I'm an owl.

[14:52]
Oh, right.

[14:55]
Okay, now you're just showing off.

[14:59]
Are you okay? Ow.

[15:01]
Stay back! There's more pinecones where that came from.

[15:04]
-Let us take you to the hospital. -I can't go back to no hospital.

[15:08]
This is the fourth time I've been hit this year.

[15:10]
Maybe you shouldn't wear camouflage track suits.

[15:12]
I don't have health care. I didn't pay my bills, so I'm in arrears.

[15:16]
A deer in arrears. Ha, ha.

[15:19]
[in English accent] What's that? She can't hear you.

[15:21]
She's got a deer in her ears.

[15:24]
Look, pal, I'll pay the bill, just-- Just let us get you to a damn hospital.

[15:27]
-I don't know. -[in normal voice] I know you've been hurt

[15:30]
and I know you're afraid. We're all afraid.

[15:33]
But you have to trust us. It's gonna be okay.

[15:37]
Not standing in the middle of the road will also help, in the future.

[15:40]
-You're not gonna hurt me again? -I am not going to hurt you.

[15:43]
Okay.

[15:45]
[shouting]

[15:46]
Starting now.

[16:02]
-They said he's gonna be okay. -Oh, great. Great.

[16:05]
-Wanna hear another joke? -Well, is it a joke or is it a story?

[16:09]
I'll listen to another story, if you stop calling them jokes.

[16:12]
So, there's this couple who just started dating and things are going really well.

[16:16]
One day, the girl finds a box of old love letters from her high school boyfriend.

[16:20]
She reads them and, like, loves how silly they are.

[16:23]
You know, the drama of young romance.

[16:25]
So, on a whim, she sends the letters to her ex-boyfriend

[16:28]
thinking he might find them funny too.

[16:30]
Well, okay, that night, she tells her current boyfriend about it

[16:33]
and he loses his shit.

[16:35]
They get in a huge fight about it.

[16:37]
He's all, "Why would you send your ex the old love letters?

[16:40]
He'll think you're still in love with him!"

[16:43]
And she's just like, "Relax, Brandon!"

[16:45]
-Is the boyfriend's name Brandon? -Yeah, that's the new boyfriend.

[16:49]
I forgot to mention that. It doesn't matter.

[16:51]
So, anyway, now the night is ruined because Brandon is obsessed.

[16:55]
He's like, "That ex-boyfriend's going to come back for you.

[16:58]
He knows where you live!"

[16:59]
So, after dinner, he drives her home.

[17:01]
She lives in one of those big buildings by the freeway.

[17:04]
And he walks her to her door,

[17:06]
but he forgets to lock the car and leaves the windows down.

[17:10]
He kisses her good night, but things are kind of weird, you know?

[17:14]
Then he gets back in his car and starts to drive away,

[17:17]
but when he glances in his rear-view mirror,

[17:19]
his blood turns cold.

[17:22]
Guess what's in the back seat.

[17:24]
-The ex-boyfriend? -No. The bag of mulch!

[17:28]
What? Oh.

[17:30]
Wow, that is actually a really good joke.

[17:33]
I told you. Some things take time.

[17:39]
[Carolyn] I'll take you home.

[17:41]
-Oh, come on, stick around a little. -Nope. I gotta take Todd home.

[17:44]
Had a wonderful time. Really. It just flew by.

[17:46]
-Come on, Todd, get in the car. -[Todd] Okay.

[17:49]
[mumbling]

[17:53]
Um, do you wanna talk about what happened?

[17:56]
What happened? No, I don't wanna talk about what happened,

[17:59]
-I just wanna clean up. -Okay.

[18:01]
-Why? What do you think happened? -I just--

[18:04]
Because what I think happened is that BoJack's girlfriend asked

[18:07]
what Tony Curtis was up to and I said, "Tony Curtis died."

[18:10]
-And you said, "Did he?" -Right, but---

[18:12]
And I said, "Yes, he did." And you said, "Really?

[18:15]
-I'm not sure about that." -Yeah--

[18:16]
And I said, "Well, I am." And you said, "I'm not so sure."

[18:20]
And I said, "I'm telling you, Tony Curtis is dead."

[18:22]
And you said, "Let's check the Internet."

[18:24]
And I said, "We don't need to check the Internet, I'm telling you he's dead."

[18:27]
And you said, "Let's just check though."

[18:30]
Is that what you think happened?

[18:33]
So, do you wanna talk about it?

[18:34]
It kind of feels like you wanna talk about it.

[18:37]
I don't understand why you couldn't just believe that I know something.

[18:40]
I believe you know lots of things.

[18:42]
I just thought, what's the harm in checking?

[18:44]
Especially since we have these amazing little boxes now

[18:47]
with 24-hour access to the world's largest source of information.

[18:51]
You shouldn't have to check if your wife knows what she's talking about.

[18:54]
You humiliated me in front of all my friends.

[18:56]
You can give it a rest. Show's over.

[18:58]
Okay, but don't I get a little bit of credit

[19:01]
for inviting all of your friends to an awesome surprise party?

[19:05]
No, because why did you think I would want an awesome surprise party?

[19:09]
Is it the awesome part you object to or...?

[19:12]
You always just assume that everyone wants whatever you want.

[19:15]
Well, you know what they say about assuming.

[19:17]
Makes an ass out of you and "ming."

[19:20]
Who's Ming?

[19:21]
[groans]

[19:23]
I'm sorry, Diane. Okay? I'm sorry I threw you a party.

[19:27]
What a monster.

[19:29]
Throwing you a party like some sort of terrorist.

[19:32]
It's a well-known fact that if you really hate someone,

[19:34]
really wanna hit them where it hurts, throw them a party.

[19:37]
That's why when we go to war, we don't drop bombs on the enemy.

[19:40]
We drop parties! So, I'm so sorry I threw you an amazing party.

[19:46]
You didn't throw me an amazing party. You threw you an amazing party.

[19:50]
Everything today has been about you.

[19:51]
Really? That picnic we had in the tea garden was about me?

[19:55]
That trip to the library was about me?

[19:58]
"Women on the Wall: An Exploration of Gender in Text and Media,

[20:01]
Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer in conversation with Helen Molesworth"

[20:05]
was about me?!

[20:06]
Oh, sure. Fine. Just walk away.

[20:10]
[shouts]

[20:12]
Oh. So now you're gonna play in the ball pit without me? Real mature, Diane.

[20:15]
Why does my birthday party have a ball pit?

[20:18]
-So I could get these T-shirts made. -Ugh.

[20:22]
Also, you once told me that when you were a little girl,

[20:25]
you dreamed of living in a house that had a ballroom.

[20:28]
-A ballroom is not a room full-- No! -Heads up! Yes!

[20:32]
Mr. Peanutbutter, some part of you must have known I wouldn't like any of this.

[20:36]
But I went balls-to-the-wall for this party.

[20:38]
Literally, there are balls all the way to the wall.

[20:41]
Right, but I've told you so many times, I don't like parties.

[20:44]
But it's the thought that counts, right?

[20:46]
That's exactly-- The thought was... Ugh!

[20:54]
-What did you do to the spare bedroom? -Every room has a theme.

[20:58]
And this room's theme is Starbucks.

[21:00]
-Starbucks is not a theme. -Can we not fight in the Starbucks?

[21:03]
I don't wanna be a couple who fights at Starbucks.

[21:05]
Okay. Fine. You did go all out.

[21:09]
I really thought you'd like this. I know you love Starbucks.

[21:12]
-I don't love-- -You don't love Starbucks,

[21:14]
you love the independent coffee place, Starbucks is more convenient.

[21:17]
-Yeah. -See?

[21:19]
I do sometimes listen.

[21:21]
-Can I get you a decaf Americano? -Sure.

[21:24]
I know you put a lot of thought into today and I appreciate that, really--

[21:28]
I have a decaf Americano on the bar for Darren.

[21:31]
Is there a Darren here?

[21:33]
Says Darren on the cup.

[21:35]
Thank you. This is very realistic.

[21:37]
I know, right?

[21:39]
You wanna go check out the pool? I filled it up with Jell-O.

[21:46]
[Diane] Ah.

[21:48]
I still can't believe I'm 35.

[21:51]
Would you believe I'm 35?

[21:53]
[chuckles]

[21:54]
-I'm still mad at you. -I know.

[21:57]
But I don't wanna be.

[21:58]
Well, I don't want you to be mad at me either.

[22:00]
We only have so many days together. I want every one to be a happy one.

[22:04]
Oh, my God. You don't want me to go to Cordovia.

[22:07]
-What?! -You don't think I know what it means

[22:10]
when you say shit like...

[22:11]
"We only have so many days together"?

[22:15]
-Uh, what? -"Diane, I love waking up next to you."

[22:19]
"Diane, I wish every day could be like this."

[22:23]
-Yeah, but-- -"Just the two of us, together."

[22:26]
Do you have any idea how that feels when I'm trying to plan my trip?

[22:29]
Okay. You got me!

[22:31]
Maybe I don't want my wife,

[22:33]
whom I love, to go off on a terrifying six-month tour

[22:37]
of the most war-torn, disease-splattered corners of the planet

[22:40]
with a charming, handsome, billionaire bachelor.

[22:43]
What could I be thinking? I'm such a terrible husband.

[22:46]
I'm not happy.

[22:49]
-With me? -I don't know.

[22:52]
With everything.

[22:53]
I wake up in the morning and I feel like I have no purpose.

[22:57]
And I'm 35. And if I don't make some change in my life,

[23:00]
then this is how I'm gonna feel forever.

[23:03]
-Honey-- -But then I think

[23:05]
about Sebastian St. Clair and going to work with him,

[23:08]
helping people and making a difference.

[23:10]
And I feel like I have a reason to get out of bed.

[23:14]
I didn't know you felt that way.

[23:16]
If you told me that, I would have heard it.

[23:18]
Mr. Peanutbutter, you know I love you and think you're a good dog.

[23:21]
Yes, you are. Yes, you are, and I love your cute, funny face,

[23:25]
but I don't wanna be one of those couples

[23:27]
that settles into a routine and never changes.

[23:30]
Well, I don't know what to say because I'm an old dog

[23:33]
and I'm not gonna change.

[23:35]
Do you know what I do while you're at work all day?

[23:39]
I mostly just sit right there.

[23:41]
Sometimes I pretend to dig a little hole and then I take a nap.

[23:45]
And when I hear your car in the driveway, it is the best part of my day.

[23:50]
I mean, I go insane.

[23:52]
I know, and I love you so much,

[23:55]
but you're never going to be my only priority like that.

[23:58]
That's just not how I'm wired.

[24:01]
I need to also live my life.

[24:03]
Well... okay.

[24:07]
Is it okay?

[24:08]
If I change and try new things and you still love me?

[24:14]
And you just stay the same person you've always been and I still love you?

[24:17]
Uh, yeah, that sounds good to me. Does that work for you?

[24:22]
Yeah, I think that works.

[24:25]
Just don't throw me any more surprise parties, okay?

[24:28]
Uh, yeah, noted.

[24:31]
I can't believe you got me a ball pit.

[24:33]
And you're saying no part of you wants to go jump in that ball pit right now?

[24:37]
[Diane] Well, maybe a little.

[24:39]
-Does that make me a hypocrite? -No, it just means you changed.

[24:42]
It's one of the things I love about you.

[24:49]
Surprise!

[24:52]
Hello? Anybody?

[24:54]
This is Paul McCartney.

[24:57]
I came all this way to jump out of a cake? Honest.

[25:01]
With a new suit on... Aye-yai-yai.
